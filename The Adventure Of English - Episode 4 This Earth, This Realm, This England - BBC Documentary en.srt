00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,930
in the first three programs in this

2
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,939
series we've seen English language grow

3
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,590
from a ruff the wonderfully expressive

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,619
dialect to Chaucer's English and a

5
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,500
language fit the Tyndall's Bible now the

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:01:09,070
language makes a dramatic leap forward

7
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,870
over 400 years ago here on London

8
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,470
Southbank

9
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,690
lived and worked a man who was to become

10
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,760
the greatest English writer the greatest

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,040
master of language of all time William

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,090
Shakespeare Shakespeare wrote at the end

13
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,770
of the 16th and the beginning of the

14
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,080
17th century this was the period of the

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,000
English Renaissance a word that was

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,070
borrowed from French meaning rebirth

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,380
during this time the English language

18
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,780
too was reborn English vocabulary was

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,060
rapidly changing it expanded grew

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,920
flowered and exploded with new words

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,830
this is the story of the growth of

22
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,080
Shakespeare's English in it's an

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:57,010
adventure that starts on water

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,420
most important changes in the English

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,920
language had come about through foreign

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,200
invasions but in the late 16th century

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,780
the legendary repulsion of an invasion

28
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,970
started off a new chapter in the

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:26,640
adventure of English

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,220
in 1588 English ships were battling it

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,830
out with a Spanish Armada Elizabeth the

32
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,330
first was queen of three and a half

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,760
million subjects and determined not to

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,980
surrender for a much stronger and much

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,770
bigger enemy she appeared before a crowd

36
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,770
at the port of Tobruk and using all her

37
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,510
skill in rhetoric together with the

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,730
power of an English language growing

39
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,160
rapidly in richness and eloquence she

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:03:01,570
delivered her rallying I am coming to

41
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,480
live or die amongst you all to lay down

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,240
for my gods and for my kingdom and for

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,360
my people my honor and my Bloods evil in

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,940
the duct I know I have the body of a

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,310
weak and feeble woman but I had the

46
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,800
heart and banner of a king and never

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,040
King of England to not Spain not any

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,020
Prince of Europe so dare to invade the

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,590
borders will pluck up your heart by your

50
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,630
piece in temp and your better in the

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,489
fields we shall shortly have a famous

52
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,860
victory

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,000
Elizabeth's famous call to arms at

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,980
Tilbury delivered here by Dame flora

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,950
robson in this 1937 film has been told

56
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,240
and retold for over 400 years

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,280
it's because Elizabeth understood how to

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
use the new power and resonance of the

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,450
English language to inspire her people

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,040
and this new power of the English

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,230
language reflected the naval strength of

62
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,210
a small country that was able to hold

63
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:02,930
off the Spanish Armada

64
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,099
but Elizabethan ships for doing

65
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,750
something far more important still as

66
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,920
far as language was concerned a naval

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,670
supremacy opened up the world to trade

68
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,410
as England imported a huge cargo of

69
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,209
goods the English language imported the

70
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,090
cargo vocabulary alongside a stunning 10

71
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,160
to 12 thousand new words entered English

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,259
in the spirit bringing with them new

73
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,780
ideas

74
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,070
by the time of the Spanish Armada

75
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,290
English was still lagging behind other

76
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,360
European languages and the influence is

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,770
exerted in the newly conquered

78
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,170
territories abroad Portuguese had

79
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,150
already made its mark in Brazil and

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,280
Spanish had been spoken Cuba and Mexico

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,980
for more than half a century elsewhere

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,810
Arabic had spread through the Middle

83
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,190
East over eight hundred years earlier

84
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,860
and Hindi was comfortably establishing

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,870
itself as a vernacular if not a literary

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,490
language throughout the Indian region

87
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,050
but on a very much smaller scale English

88
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,640
was at least beginning to make its mark

89
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
during the sixteenth century it had

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
begun to spread to parts of Wales

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,230
Scotland and Ireland English was

92
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,150
spreading but English was also absorbing

93
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,040
some of the thousands of new words had

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,510
entered the language came from just

95
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,780
across the channel

96
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,190
England's thriving maritime trade was

97
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,590
most successful close to home and it's

98
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,420
not surprising that French which had a

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,040
long history of providing words to

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,810
English was to provide English with many

101
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,150
of its nautical and meteorological terms

102
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,870
words like crew detail Passport progress

103
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,720
moustache and Explorer were traded in

104
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,090
English for French rule under maritime

105
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,150
terms like embargo tornado canoe and

106
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,400
port come to us from both Spanish and

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,330
Portuguese we get keelhaul smuggle yacht

108
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,970
decoy cruise and reef along with

109
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,110
knapsack and landscape from Dutch and

110
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,730
although the popular myth is an

111
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,890
anglo-saxon game English all its swear

112
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,530
words he was sailors that brought us

113
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,470
 crap and bugger from low Dutch

114
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,490
now called Flemish in the 16th century

115
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,870
Anglo Saxon is an eclair

116
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,430
but these sailors brought back more than

117
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:35,189
just colorful language

118
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,719
they're trading expeditions to Europe

119
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,669
and the Spanish mane literally bore

120
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,589
fruit and barrel loads of other goods

121
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,449
that was to affect the English language

122
00:06:43,449 --> 00:07:06,880
but the most domestic of levels

123
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,560
more of our food began to come from

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,570
abroad in many of our food terms have

125
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,670
renaissance origins spanish and

126
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,620
portuguese gave us new delicacies and

127
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,870
new words for them to hear and Borough

128
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,400
Market which would have existed in

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,680
Shakespeare's day we can see these goods

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,930
such as apricots bananas

131
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,460
lime mandarin yams potatoes and

132
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,240
anchovies coco maize and port wine

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,590
meanwhile the words for chocolate and

134
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:48,419
tomato come to us from the French

135
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,360
and the sailors and traders told tales

136
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,940
of new world words from a total of 50

137
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,370
other languages joined the cargo of new

138
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,500
words that were integrated into English

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,150
English now bristled with newly imported

140
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,310
terms from overseas like Shi from

141
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,439
Chinese bamboo and ketchup from Malay

142
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,379
and curry from Tamil during the 16th

143
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,270
century English also imported yoghurt

144
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,150
and hoard from Turkish bazaar and turban

145
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,699
from Persia and coffee magazine and

146
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:30,770
alcohol from Arabic it wasn't just the

147
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,719
traders who returned to England burying

148
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
their exotic goods and linguistic wealth

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,409
English artists and scholars and

150
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,329
aristocrats explored Italy and its

151
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,680
culture which was the dominating

152
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,930
influence of that time there they

153
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,610
wondered at the architecture of the

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,740
scions and the music carrying back new

155
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,720
ideas and a sumptuous lexicon to

156
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,300
describe them so balcony still

157
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,829
pronounced at that time in the Italian

158
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,190
manner balcony as well as fresco villa

159
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,920
cupola portico piazza miniature and

160
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,410
designer all from italian as a opera

161
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,220
violin solo sonata soprano trill cameo

162
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:28,089
and carnival

163
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,709
but the biggest influx of words came

164
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,569
from the classical languages Latin and

165
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,759
Greek in the sixteenth century here at

166
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,829
Oxford and also at Cambridge there are

167
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,869
nestled scholars wanted to revive Latin

168
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,300
they found in schools teaching pure and

169
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,129
literary Latin and Greek and they also

170
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:53,050
translated classical texts into English

171
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,240
Latin is still used ceremonially today

172
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,999
at Oxford University in the 16th century

173
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,249
it was not only the language of religion

174
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,959
but also the language of classical

175
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:13,939
thought science and philosophy Latin was

176
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,649
the language of scholarship controversy

177
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,319
and diplomacy English scholars spoke and

178
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,999
wrote in Latin so that they could

179
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,829
communicate and debate with other

180
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:34,290
European scholars

181
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,910
Lattin had been spoken by some people in

182
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,160
england for over 1,500 years since Roman

183
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,110
times but they was the language of

184
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,269
scholarship on an everyday basis things

185
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,550
were changing everyone from the common

186
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,050
people to the academics and the Queen

187
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,720
now spoke English and not Latin even the

188
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,879
Latin was still a compulsory subject in

189
00:10:51,879 --> 00:11:04,310
schools

190
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,770
there was a great ransacking fervor in

191
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,150
the English language which was at its

192
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,610
peak for 20 years the decade on either

193
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,400
side of the earth 1600 saw thousands of

194
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,020
Latin words come into the English

195
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,270
vocabulary of educated people words like

196

199
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,570
even the words of manuscript and lexical

200
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,850
were absorbed into English during these

201
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,930
two decades Latin and Greek were the

202
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,700
perfect building blocks for a new

203
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,830
English vocabulary to describe the new

204
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,990
concepts techniques and inventions that

205
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,700
were coming in from continental Europe

206
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,730
during the Renaissance this was a period

207
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,589
of great intellectual and scientific

208
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:51,500
fervor during this time were invented

209
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,330
both the ideas and the words for

210
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,029

211

212
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,990
Greek inspired words such as paradox

213
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,230
eternal and chronology. In fact concepts

214
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,180
and inventions are themselves words

215
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,730
borrowed from Latin and technique is of

216
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,390
Greek origin the developing field of

217
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,770
medicine particularly relied on

218
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,350
classical words still today medical

219
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,480
terms were in Latin and Greek and many

220
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,280
date from the Renaissance amongst the

221
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,900
words that arrived at that time from

222
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,630
Greek via Latin were skeleton tendon

viruses detecting pneumonia delirium and

thermometers tonics and capsules to cure

229
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,640
them are all words of classical origin

230
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,560
in fact even now we use Latin and Greek

231
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,020
for medicine and technology the Greek di

235
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,680
most recent additions to the oxford

236
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,600
english dictionary this year was the

237
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,700
phrase quantum computation which is

238
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,330
purely Latin in origin Latin seems set

239
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,760
to Honeycomb English but not everyone

240
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,890
agreed with what critics called new

241
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,970
inkhorn

242
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,220
terms descent was growing among the

243
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,059
scholars

244
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,879
you said for the national uproar of the

245
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:29,010
inkhorn controversy

246
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,800
the inkhorn controversy named after the

247
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,440
horn pot which held ink for quills was

248
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,750
the first formal dispute about the

249
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,120
English language never before had there

250
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,829
been such a consciousness of what the

251
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,560
English language was and should be what

252
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,050
began was a few testy written outbursts

253
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,269
culminated in a full-blown academic

254
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,180
background.

255
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,130
Many scholars objected to the increasing

256
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,079
incursion of Latin and Greek words. A key

257
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,269
figure among them was Sir John Cheke who

258
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,250
was published at King's College here in

259
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,290
Cambridge he argued strongly that

260
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,510
English should not be polluted by other

261
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,399
tongues ironically Cheke was a

262
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,019
classicist and the first Regius

263
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,459
professor of Greek in Cambridge

264
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,529
nevertheless she felt that English

265
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,779
should be reappraised as a Germanic

266
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,699
language going back to its anglo-saxon

267
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,860
roots. He even invented words like

268
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,860
crossed for crucified gain rising for

269
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,199
resurrection ground rot for founded

270
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,350
collar for publican moon for lunatic for

271
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,660
sale for profit and hundreder  for

272
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,199
Centurion. "I am of this opinion that our

273
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,420
own tongue should be written clean and

274
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,709
pure unmixed an unmanned gold with

275
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,100
borrowing of other tongues when if we take

276
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,850
not heed by time ever borrowing and

277
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,449
never pay, she shall be fain to keep her

278
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,930
house as bankrupt".

279
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,760
Cheke wrote about the bankruptcy and

280
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
counterfeiting of the pure English

281
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,150
language but it's again ironic that the

282
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,510
very word to use words like bankrupt

283
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,650
counterfeiting and indeed the word pure

284
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,260
itself art of anglo-saxon or Germanic

285
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,180
origin at all they're from the Latin

286
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:23,990
based languages Italian and French the

287
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,880
cheeks enthusiasm for English brought

288
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
about something else which is

289
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,510
significant here in the Protocollum book

290
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,640
and the records of admission to Kings

291
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,710
College the name of the book is Latin

292
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,660
and it's written in Latin the gridding

293
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,030
beneath Cheke's entry for the very first

294
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,310
time in this book is a text in English

295
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,730
this short English note was the first

296
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,350
chink in the classical armor that have

297
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,540
protected scholarship and isolated it

298
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,880
from everyday people look it starts off

299
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,510
in Latin if we can decipher it a Gradius

300
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,190
via Maggie's tray you're Hannah's cheek

at mrs. threw it in verum at epitome the

302

positive aleady regardless predictive

303
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,040
which means that this were demands on

304e
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,050
Cheke was admitted into the true and

305
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,750
perpetual Provost ship of the aforesaid

306
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,910
King's college but underneath it is a

307
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,740
short passage and this is the quiet

308
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,940
revolution which is in english it says

309
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,540
first of all I do protest and declare

310
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,890
that otherwise I do not swear or promise

311
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,490
anything

312
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,110
by that should bind me contrary to the

313
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,860
true doctrine of the Church of England

314
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,420
but however Hardy tried to promote a

315
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,730
pure English cheek and his supporters

316
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,010
couldn't stand the huge influx of

317
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,630
Latinate words that people have started

318
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,300
using no one could control the English

319
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,520
language by the end of the sixteenth

320
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
century over a period of some sixty or

321
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,330
so years the building blocks have been

322
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,610
laid to create a language that we can

323
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,950
still understand today that we call

324
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,700
modern English in the modern English

325
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,890
that we read and speak today we hear

326
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,900
some of these Latinate words that seem

327
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,150
oddest at the time but some of these

328
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,130
have survived 16th and early 17th
survive
329
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,190
century words like industrial

330
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,850
exaggerated mundane permit transmit

331
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,670
capacity disagree disabuse necessitate

332
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,790
an expectation external celebrate and

333
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,270
extol cures at the time but we use them

334
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,810
today

335
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,180
however cheek may have taken some

336
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,740
comfort in the fact that some of the

337
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,090
thousands of Latin and Greek words

338
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,220
coined during the great inkhorn

339
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,620
controversy didn't survive. Through a

340
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,660
process of natural selection 

341
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,760
"obtestate" to bear witness and fatigate to

342
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,590
make tired have been lost as have

343
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,080
“illecebrous” meaning delicate or "deruncinate”

344
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,870
 to weed. “Abstergify” to cleanse

345
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,780
"arreption” a sudden removal and “subsecive”

346
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,700
remaining over of all slipped out of use.

347
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,610
“Nidulate” to build a nest, "latrate” to

348
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,140
bark like a dog pity about that and

349
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,330
“suppeditate” the supply, have also

350
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,760
disappeared whilst a word like impede

351
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,270
survived its opposite "expede" didn't. As

352
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,010
we explored the globe so at home we

353
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,990
explored the world of words it's fun to

354
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,850
poke fun with these questions but they

355
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,040
demonstrate the intense interest the

356
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,970
English language inspired people from

357
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,890
the Queen to a young grammar school boy

358
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,360
from Stratford William Shakespeare of

359
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,430
course were reading an English language

360
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,230
that was flush with thousands of new

361
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,900
words and ideas it was an English that

362
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,820
could be used as a tool of power to

363
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,800
rally spirits against foreign invasions

364
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,020
but he was also in English which could

365
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,540
and did create a literature of the most

366
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,690
remarkable poetry and flexibility

367
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,040
English already had a great author in

368
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Chaucer but now the English language was

369
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,680
to take on an even bigger challenge to

370
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:17,430
lay the foundations or a world language

371
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,980
in the 16th century English was a

372
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,900
delicate flowering language that needed

373
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,710
to be protected it had long been in the

374
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,140
shadow of other European languages there

375
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,490
was such an interest in these languages

376
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,380
that glossaries were compiled in the

377
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,270
form of bilingual Italian to English

378
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,340
French to English and Spanish to English

379
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:47,650
dictionary's

380
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,059
English was finer to get its very own

381
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,880
dictionary 8 years before Italian 35

382
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,550
years before French but 800 years after

383
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,710
Arabic and nearly a 1000 years after

384
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:09,350
Sanskrit. The word dictionary is first

385
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,870
used in its latin form

386
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,450
dictionaries in 1225 by an english

387
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,440
scholar and in many ways a dictionary is

388
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,910
particularly suited to the english

389
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,890
language the language which has absorbed

390
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,990
so many others

391
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,669
the very first English dictionary is put

392
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,190
together in 1604 by Robert Corddry he

393
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,830
called it a table alphabetical and this

394
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,809
is it it's a list of english words

395
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,270
mainly of Latinate origin with the brief

396
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,260
explanation so we can see that the very

397
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,330
first word in this only surviving copy

398
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,960
of this tiny dictionary is abandon cast

399
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,220
away or yield up to leave or forsake we

400
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,460
see that malady is a disease or that

401
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,929
some early is briefly or in few words

402
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,559
argue is to reason geometry is the art

403
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,160
of measuring the earth elegance is

404
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,919
finesse of speech an empire is

405
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,980
government or Kingdom quadrangle is

406
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,040
four-cornered and radiant is shining

407
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,100
bright there are only two thousand five

408
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,690
hundred and forty-three words in this

409
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,640
very first English dictionary it was a

410
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,890
meagre word horde but a first attempt at

411
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,690
a collection it's by no means exhaustive

412
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,360
you don't find everyday words like shoe

413
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,980
cold food or house cow wet rain dress

414
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,010
fish or love more than anything this

415
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,200
little book was a recognition of the new

416
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,750
status of the English language as it

417
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,120
declared on its first page full of hard

418
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,730
usual English words borrowed from the

419
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,900
Hebrew Greek Latin or French Corddry

420
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,820
intended this dictionary to be used by

421
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,559
those who might not understand words

422
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,600
which they shall hear or read in

423
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,020
scriptures sermons or elsewhere this

424
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,240
wasn't a book for scholars it was a book

425
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,010
for the ordinary people to catalog new

426
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,900
words and to explain the new ideas

427
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,480
associated with these words this was

428
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,919
because the English population was

429
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,140
growing more and more educated one

430
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,049
estimate is that by 1600 half of the

431
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,700
three and a half million population at

432
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,370
least in citizen towns had some minimal

433
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,659
literacy

434
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,759
but it was the good education of those

435
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,470
brought up around the world of the

436
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,479
Elizabethan Court in Grand homes like

437
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,139
this one,

438
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:33,269
Henry VIII's place in Kent that was to

439
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,399
contribute strikingly to the adventure

440
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:41,789
of English in England thousands of new

441
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,559
words were absorbed into the English

442
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,220
language

443
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,139
with these words came an intense

444
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:48,779
interest in how to use them the study of

445
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,239
rhetoric the art of public speaking and

446
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,129
Composition became part of a good

447
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:55,559
education and rhetoric had a fine

448
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,840
spokeswoman and speech writer in Queen

449
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,039
Elizabeth the first who excelled at it

450
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,989
she was a literary and educated monarch

451
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:06,539
she had private tutors she spoke six

452
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,639
languages and translated French and

453
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,830
Latin texts furthermore Elizabeth

454
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:17,340
enjoyed writing poetry I grieve and dare

455
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,989
not show my discontent I love and yet

456
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:26,789
unforced to seem to hate I do yet dare

457
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,559
not say I ever meant I seems dark mute

458
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,629
but inwardly do prate English was

459
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:38,639
looking for a literature to reflect its

460
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,070
newly enriched status and it was to the

461
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,789
courtiers

462
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,190
the Knights of Elizabeth entourage that

463
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,989
the role fell to turn the English

464
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,749
language into literature the gentleman

465
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,820
poet who handled the pen with as much

466
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,159
skill as the sword he was called up to

467
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,259
play his part in the adventure of

468
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:05,860
English

469
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,630
the courtier wrote for pleasure and for

470
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,730
him writing playing and molding the

471
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,650
language all became things to aspire to

472
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,110
there even existed manuals of rhetoric

473
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,820
that advised would be caught your poets

474
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,460
on the best composing techniques the

475
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,320
perfect embodiment of the courtier poet

476
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,600
was a heroic nobleman who was born here

477
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,170
in pencils place in 1554 Sir Philip

478
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,680
Sidney. By his mid-twenties Sidney had

479
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,600
already worked as Elizabeth's ambassador

480
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,250
abroad and had written the finest

481
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,960
collection of beloved firms of his age

482
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,840
he died in battle when he was only 31

483
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,600
and achieved lasting fame for giving his

484
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,580
water bottle to another wounded soldier

485
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,040
with the words "thy need is greater than

486
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,410
mine"

487
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,210
Above all he had the leisure education

488
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,420
and wit to make English the subject of

489
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,430
both his poetry and his treatise about

490
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,460
language "An apologie for Poetrie". Sidney

491
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,440
composed music and songs he wrote for

492
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,570
pleasure and for art's sake not for a

493
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:09,500
living. Fly fly my friends ,I have my

494
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,790

495

fly. See there that boy that murthring

496
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,930

497
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,680

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,399

499
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,229
I talked to Katherine Duncan Jones

500
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,299
Oxford Don and Britain's leading expert

501
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:33,070
on the work of Philip Sidney about his

502
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,700
importance to the English language what

503
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,940
was new about that Pam I thought was new

504
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,089
was the application of very bold still

505
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:47,409
very fresh immediate words to what might

506
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,229
be called a very trite clichéd situation

507
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:54,339
words like bloody bullet and thief who

508
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,700
like a thief hid in dark bush to fly

509
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,710
that murdering boy which make it sound

510
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,659
as if the speaker has just been mugged

511
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,330
and fatally wounded by one of these

512
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,279
juvenile criminals who were very common

513
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,129
in Elizabethan tongues and villages and

514
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:11,769
I'm afraid is still very common now and

515
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,570
I think like many of semi-solid says

516
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,429
it's a sort of trick performance with

517
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,169
language that he makes us think we're

518
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,419
reading something very surprising and

519
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,469
new well it's just that tardo story of

520
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:25,389
cupid shooting with a group Golden Arrow

521
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:27,519
but bloodied bullet makes it sound

522
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,929
completely different as if it's a

523
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:29,940
gunshot wound

524
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,320
what in general you think Sydney did

525
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,759
with the language that was given him

526
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,409
this sort of core Charis man penning

527
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,759
what could be a new English what was he

528
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,339
doing but he was enormously expanding it

529
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,389
if you look at the Oxford English

530
00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:45,940
Dictionary online look up Philip Sidney

531
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:53,289
there are 2225 he was expanding it

532
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,539
enormous Lee both the usages and the

533
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,989
actual words with foreign words probably

534
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:01,029
some words there were all all some words

535
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:02,769
that hadn't been used in literary

536
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,279
language before words from words that he

537
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,289
had made up essentially by turning nouns

538
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,649
into verbs and creating new adverbs and

539
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:13,659
new forms of speech like describing a

540
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,759
cat saying the cat is moving scratching

541
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,499
Lee and nobody had ever thought of

542
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,179
describing a cat we were in scratching

543
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,450
lifts before numerous first usages are

544
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,700
attributed to Philip Sidney bud bar

545
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,109
scummy as a term of abuse dumb stricken

546
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:31,419
miniature for a small picture he was

547
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:33,339
fond of adding words together to form

548
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:35,799
evocative images ranging from milk white

549
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,850
horses by pleasing fire

550
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,240
well shading trees to more unusual ones

551
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
like honey flowing eloquence hang worthy

552
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,760
necks or even long with the love

553
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,880
acquainted eyes. Could you say that at the

554
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,350
round the time of Sydney English was

555
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,930
becoming a modern language. I think it

556
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,180
was because I think there was this sense

557
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,100
that very modern things of the

558
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,990
absolutely present moment could be done

559
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,590
with it

560
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,930
as of course happens now with the new

561
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,520
words we have with every almost every

562
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,300
month new words into our language was

563
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,160
that exciting in sense that it was a

564
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,400
language which was both very historical

565
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,100
and carried many relics of Latin and

566
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,990
Greek conception and yet was absolutely

567
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,210
streetwise what ideas were was Sydney

568
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,310
bringing that had not been expressed for

569
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,250
as well expressed before English and

570
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,090
English culture could be as rich as

571
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,580
French Italian even to name the enemies

572
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,160
Spanish culture Cynthia was very well

573
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,840
informed about Spanish literature and

574
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,870
culture too was actually Philip of Spain

575
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,170
godson named after him so confidence in

576
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,480
in the English language as a medium in

577
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,430
which great works of art could be

578
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,090
produced and everyday transactions could

579
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,400
be carried on they didn't have to be in

580
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,260
Latin or in the kind of French was by

581
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,880
diplomats the English language could

582
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,680
actually be used for important matters

583
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,660
of state where be the roses gone which

584
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,530
sweetened so our eyes where were those

585
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,740
red cheeks which oft with varying

586
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,470
creased in frame the height of honor in

587
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,450
the kindly badge of shame

588
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,510
who have the crimson we've stolen from

589
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:34,520
my morning skies which words phrases

590
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,650
comic fight phrases like my better half

591
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,050
for a much-loved spouse which actually

592
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,880
in its context in Sydney's tragic and

593
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,250
now is the sort of sitcom cliche I'll

594
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,960
see what my better half thinks about

595
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,970
that but I think when that rather be

596
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,010
said phrases use people have no idea it

597
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,210
goes back to Sydney's Arcadia well it's

598
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,980
this is not solution if it word like

599
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,440
far-fetched as applied to a narrative or

600
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,480
even what we're doing now Melvyn having

601
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
a conversation commune exchanging speech

602
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,860
simply brought that into the language

603
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,530
conversation used to me and just having

604
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,050
dealings of an undefined kind with other

605
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,720
people but the specific application to

606
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,970
having dealings through language with

607
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,200
Sydney's. But for the uttering sweetly

608
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,800
and properly the conceits of the mind

609
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,980
which is the end of speech that happy

610
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,100
equally with any other tongue in the

611
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,850
world English had it equally with any

612
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,680
other tongue in the world there's a

613
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,110
sense of triumph uh a victory even the

614
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,400
sweet smell of success

615
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,010
Sydney was one of the courtly stars of

616
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,680
poetry poetry became the benchmark for

617
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,440
English by the 1600s purged like John

618
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,720
Donne Edmund Spencer Ben Johnson George

619
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
Herbert and many more were writing lines

620
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,920
like Johnson's drink to me only with

621
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
thine eyes or Duns

622
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,700
no man is an island they become everyday

623
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,830
expressions and in polishing their

624
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,930
technique the poets also polished

625
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,000
English as a language fit for the most

626
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,940
testing poetic and dramatic endeavors

627
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,590
but the flowery sonnets of the gentleman

628
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,270
poets wouldn't have been understood in

629
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,730
the area that we now know a Southwark or

630
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,549
the South Bank just outside the city of

631
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,530
London jurisdiction it was an area of

632
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,720
disrepute with thieves and vagabonds

633
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,270
taverns and brothels it was a red-light

634
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,000
district of London in the 1590s the

635
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,919
prostitutes and thieves who prowled

636
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,840
around this area had their own street

637
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,760
slang much as local gangs today have

638
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,280
their own argot. We know the cove meant

639
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,730
man fumbles made fans gang was mouth

640
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,220
PanAm was bred and skipper was a barn

641
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,380
not many of these words have survived

642
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,480
but even today Cove is a slang word for

643
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,669
a man. Most importantly though the

644
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,559
language of the streets was a simple and

645
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,020
direct communication using single

646
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,549
syllable words and plain speech by the

647
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,890
end of the 16th century theatres were a

648
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,330
main feature in this dubious area and

649
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:14,240
the most famous was the globe.

650
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,180
By the time the globe was built in 1599

651
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,340
people had been attending performances

652
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,020
in the commercial play houses for 30

653
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,230
years and it was on these hugely popular

654
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,000
stages that something extraordinary

655
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,520
happened the playwrights of the period

656
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,070
echoed and transformed the turbulent

657
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,570
english language which they were hearing

658
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,120
combining the rich vocabulary and poetry

659
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,430
of the quarters with the slang of the

660
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,800
commoners because the theatres of the

661
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,870
time had no scenery and barely any props

662
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,060
language was the means of choice on the

663
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,520
stage to captivate the audience and the

664
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,260
scene was set for the most famous

665
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,730
dramatist of them all William

666
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,130
Shakespeare to make his indelible mark

667
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,670
on the English language the plays that

668
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,680
were written by Shakespeare as well as

669
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,120
those of his contemporaries such as

670
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,010
Marlo Johnson and Nash attracted

671
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,710
enormous crowds the globe could hold

672
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,890
between 3,000 and 3,500 people

673
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,200
and the other five theaters in London

674
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
could easily rival a globe a 10-day run

675
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,450
for a play counted as a long one and the

676
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,880
London population the merely two hundred

677
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,530
thousand inhabitants about the same

678
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,500
population a Sunderland today demanded

679
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,890
constant novelty and excitement

680
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,780
it's astonishing to realize that a box-office  

681
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,030
hit like Shakespeare's Titus

682
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,250
Andronicus would have been seen by one

683
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,400
in two men in London. Genius and the new

684
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,590
mix of language was bringing together a

685
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,690
mix of society in the popular play

686
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,510
houses. English is seeding the words was

687
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,370
no longer restricted to the scholars and

688
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,470
the quarter poets. With Shakespeare and

689
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,510
his contemporaries English had a new

690
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,000
audience it was ready to travel the

691
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,730
world. All the world's a stage and all

692
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,720
the men and women merely players they

693
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,150
have their exits and their entrances and

694
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,580
one man in his time plays many parts his

695
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:32,820
acts being seven ages

696
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,650
this is stratford-upon-avon

697
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,060
Shakespeare's birthplace English's

698
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,800
best-selling author has served the town

699
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,260
weld three million tourists visit every

700
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,150
year making Shakespeare English's

701
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,690
biggest export. The beauty of

702
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,220
Shakespeare's language is that we can

703
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,770
still understand it today

704
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,850
Shakespeare's English has become so

705
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,710
quotable that it's come to define

706
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,630
English in the words that we use the

707
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,580
thoughts we express be it for native

708
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,460
speakers or students of English or for

709
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,220
tourists. For example Julius Caesar

710
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,490
friends Romans countrymen linear years,

711
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,980
to be or not to be. most important to be

712
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:21,910
and not to be that was here a mouse it's

713
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,550
a it's a good read the video not to be,

714
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,840
that is the question. The quality of

715
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,680
Mercy is not strained that's about it

716
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,710
It's my friend come from China and such

717
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,260

Romeo Romeo wherefore I don't yeah

720
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,770
dagger I see before thee me we heard

721
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,360
about Shakespeare at school and later on

722
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,130
at the theater and

723
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,310
we are interested in reading Shakespeare

724
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,520
he'll detain alums they'll detain of

725

Kedah

727
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,240
favorite all over the world

728
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,310
nice scholars today attributed 38 plays

729
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,010
154 sonnets and other major poems to

730
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,480
Shakespeare who was born in this house

731
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,970
but his biggest contribution to English

732
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,070
might be the vocabulary that we find in

733
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,350
his work well over 2,000 of our words

734
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,390
for instance today I first recorded

735
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,150
their words which broaden the way we

736
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,160
look at life tell us how we act tell us

737
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,040
how we think tell us what we value

738
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,720
although Shakespeare didn't invent them

739
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,660
for instance the words obscene

740
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,540
accommodation barefaced misanthrope

741
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,280
leapfrog and lackluster all make their

742
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,870
first appearance in his work as do

743
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,600
advertising assassination courtship

744
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,720
dexterously indistinguishable

745
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,130
premeditated and reliance over four

746
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,240
hundred years ago

747
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,670
Shakespeare already used an enormous

748
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,710
English vocabulary of at least twenty

749
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,500
one thousand different words English was

750
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,870
in a state of flux and Shakespeare was

751
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,350
perfectly placed to make the most of it

752
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,100
Shakespeare is influenced by the

753
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,840
language of ideas at the end of the

754
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,360
sixteenth century his language still

755
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,150
influences ours today in many ways his

756
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,370
words and images defined the way we

757
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:12,790
think

758
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,760
Hamlet's to thine own self be true for

759
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,770
instance explores the notion of personal

760
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,450
identity which we still probe

761
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,739
what the Dickens has nothing to do with

762
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,180
Charles but makes its first appearance

763
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,979
in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor

764
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:30,069
as good luck would have it that does two

765
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:32,829
beggars all description and salad days

766
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,499
are inherited from Antony and Cleopatra

767
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:38,229
Hamlet gave us "in my mind's eye" "caviar

768
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,479
to the general" "to be cruel to be kind" "to

769
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,579
the manor born" "hoist with his own petard"

770
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:45,039
"to hold the mirror up to nature" as the

771
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,249
lady said it's full of quotations

772
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:49,059
Shakespeare coined many of the

773
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,460
expressions we use today but "brevity is

774
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,650
the soul of wit" so I won't play "fast and

775
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,269
loose" but I'll "make a virtue of

776
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:00,700
necessity" and vanish into "thin air".

777
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,559
In many ways Stratford itself defined

778
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,969
Shakespeare's use of the English

779
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:06,700
language the Stratford of the second

780
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,499
half of the sixteenth century was a

781
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,829
village of nearly 1500 inhabitants

782
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:12,700
Shakespeare's thought of attended

783
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,670
Stratford school he would initially have

784
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,589
been taught in English but had also

785
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,210
studied the Latin classics

786
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,839
Cicero Virgil and Ovid and by the upper

787
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,729
forms it would have been forbidden to

788
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:27,400
speak in English only in Latin fine

789
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,950

790
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,230

791
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,600

792
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,070

801
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,700

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,890
picked up both French and Italian the

but Shakespeare's English education

807
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,359
would have been completed at church, this

808
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:30,790
church, Holy Trinity Church in Stratford

809
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,220
in which he was later buried. This is his

810
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,820
grave.

Tyndale's English Bible Shakespeare

814
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,510
didn't go to university and early on he

815
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,670
was mocked for that by the London ??

816
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,920
who benefited from university tutoring.

817

But just a church and a grammar school

education or to provide the young

821
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:03,369
greatest playwright Shakespeare also

822
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,050
knew about the inkhorn controversy and

823
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,210
used both a Latin words and playing

824
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,800
terms in his own writing

825
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,240
he used new words which had just

826
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,500
appeared towards the end of the

827

834
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,369
pell-mell smooth-faced widow-comfort

835
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:36,430
canker-sorrow bare-pick’t, basilico-like

836
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,859
half-blown and ill-tuned which are

837
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,000
uniquely his. But there are some words

838
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,320
which Shakespeare used which don't

839
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,660
survive our everyday language might

840
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,190
sound very different if we were saying

841
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,940
“appertainments,” “cadent" exsufflicate

842
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,750
“questrist,” “tortive,” soilure abruption

843
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,970
persistive protractive ungenitured unplausive

844
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,520
vastidity and shakespeare's longest

845
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,160
word "honorificabilitudinatibus"

846
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,980
which means with honour has sadly fallen

847
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,500
out of fashion altogether.

848
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,790
Shakespeare's vocabulary also betrays

849
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,310
his Midlands roots in his work we find

850
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,560
regional words like "keck" for "fool's

851
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,840
parsley" and "honeystalks" for "clover

852
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,480
stalks" we find "baton" which means a

853
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
cudgel and "batlet" which are still used

854
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,830
until recently to mean the bat to beat

855
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,100
clothes in the wash. You also find the

856
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,500
very ??? ??? to thrust and ??? to

857
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:51,250
smash. Sometimes I call it Devil's fly

858
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,550
thing but the general name for it the

859
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,310
everyday name for it that we use was

860
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,100
"keck". let's say I get a bit of keck for

861
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,780
the rabbits. Do you remember him saying about

862
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,750
batlet tool? edge in the yard,

863
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,300
yes we had a batlet tool

864
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,700
??? in the backyard to put there

865
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,640
well washing or you could put to soak

866
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:22,260
stuff in it you know all that morning.

867
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,520
shakespeare's regional accent is thought

868
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,960
to have sounded a bit like the locals

869
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,910
today speaking a kind of Midlands

870
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,310
English with a strong "r" in words like

871
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,910
turn and herd, "side" becomes "sider" and

872
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,060
"farmer" becomes "faarmer" Right” and “time”  

873
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,390
become “roight” and “toime.” Although nowadays

874
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,369
the stratford accent is more influenced

875
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,410
by nearby birmingham, Shakespeare's

876
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,090
Midland accent was described as having

877
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,980
been a mixture between west country and

878
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,180
Irish. we asked Peter silver a Stratford

879
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,100
man like Shakespeare to read us a

880
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,570
passage from Henry V. The even mead that

881
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,000
erst brought sweetly forth the freckled

882
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,869
cowslip, burnet and green clover. Wanting

883
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:09,790
the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank, Conceives

884
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,430
by idleness and nothing teems But

885
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,619
hateful docks, rough thistles kecksies, burrs,

886
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,260
Losing both beauty and utility.

887
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,330
It's intriguing to think of what

888
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,130
Shakespearean verse would have sounded

889
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,359
like during Renaissance.

890
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,609
John Barton an expert on speaking

891
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,140
Shakespeare thinks who would have

892
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,530
sounded like this once more into the

893
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,680
breach dear friends once more or close

894
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,700
the wall up with our English dead in

895
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,240
pace as nothing so becomes a man as

896
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,850
modest stillness and humility but when

897
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,720
the blast of war blows in our air then

898
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,810
imitates the action of the tiger stiffen

899
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,420
the sinews summon up the blood disguise

900
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,260
fair nature with hard favours rage then

901
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,140
in the eye a terrible aspect that it

902
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,260
prey through a head like the portage of

903
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,220
a brass cannon let the brow or helmets

904
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,640
as fearfully as doth the goal is rock or

905
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,380
hang and jutting his confounded bass

906
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,030
swiveled with a wild and wasteful ocean

907
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,250
Inside that wonderful speech have you

908
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,530
got any particular words or stresses

909
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,090
that you say look this is what they did

910
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,840
then that we don't do now Shakespeare

911
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,869
was very free with words and would scan

912
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:40,000
the same word differently within the

913
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
same scene or speech like whether you

914
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,060
said complete or complete that was

915
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,470
heretic licence. And for writing more

916
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:53,230
freely I think that we tend to look down

917
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,210
the wrong end of the telescope if we

918
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,960
don't allow that they actually were not

919
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,440
yet quite settled on spelling that they

920
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,380
were free to play games with words and

921
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,080
language and it was in dispute that was

922
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,880
the culture, the culture was a different

923
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,600
one which we we've tended to codify so

924
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,790
if you are asked to say what what you

925
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,050
thought what you thought was unique

926
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,730
about Shakespeare's language where would

927
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,869
you put the emphasis

928
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:22,690
it's the mono syllables that are the

929
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,109
bedrock and and life of the language and

930
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,450
I believe that is so Shakespeare the

931
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,210
high words the high phrases he sets up

932
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,450
to then bring it down

933
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,920
to the simple which explains it like

934
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,790
making the multitudinous seas

935
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,630
incarnadine making the green one red

936
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,670
there is high language what hell's he

937
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,380
talking about

938
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,020
specific clear definition and I think

939
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,380
that the heart of Shakespeare listening

940
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,560
to it for acting it is is that the great

941
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,869
lines often the most poetic lines of the

942
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,210
mono syllables but do you think that the

943
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,920
mono syllables were what would be called

944
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,829
common speech and the high lines were

945
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:07,829
Shakespeare being Latinate proving that

946
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:09,570
he didn't need university education to

947
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,420
be clever. this is the paradox high words

948
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,820
can be verbal show-off and rhetoric. Deep

949
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,390
feeling probably comes out most in more

950
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,920
syllables so I say that not to deny that

951
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,339
he teamed with word invention but I

952
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:33,300
think in some ways his the living power

953
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,250
of the language comes from the

954
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,069
interplay of the two this interplay of

955
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:39,839
the high speech with the commonplace was

956
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,880
important to Shakespeare. He was also a

957
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,790
fertile ground for comedy. He was so

958
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,160
inventive with just one insult, "knave"

959
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,099
that we can find 50 instances of it in

960
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:56,000
his plays, playing off monosyllables with more complex formation.

961
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:19,349
Foul knave! Lousy kaves. Beastly knave! Scurvy railing knave! Gorbellied knave! Bacon-fed knave! The lyingest knave in Christendom. rascally scold

962
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:25,410
deadly lousy pranking name filthy

963
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,890
roasted stocking name in "The Tempest"

964
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,810
Shakespeare's last play the main

965
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,940
character the magician Prospero uses a

966
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,280
staff that's often seen to be an image

967
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,859
for Shakespeare's quill. Shakespeare

968
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:40,440
called Prospero's magic "a potent art" and

969
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,960
Shakespeare himself used the power of

970
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,119
language to conjure up images for a

971
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,390
spellbound audience here at the globe.

972
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,100
when in Prospero's last speech he breaks

973
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,820
his staff.

974
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,100
Shakespeare is setting down his pen the

975
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,980
instrument of his own potent and magic

976
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:02,609
art.

977
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:07,230
But this rough magic I heere abjure, and, when

978
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,720
I have required some heavenly music

979
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,390
which even now I do, to work mine end

980
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,900
upon their senses that this airy charm

981
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,009
is for, I'll break my staff, bury it

982
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:22,980
certain fathoms in the earth, and deeper

983
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,259
than did ever plummet sound I'll drown

984
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:28,369
my book...

985
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:31,190
And Shakespeare put down his staff but

986
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,930
his language lives on in print in the

987
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,890
editions that have appeared

988
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,650
uninterruptedly ever since. Shakespeare's

989
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,450
english has spun around the world and

990
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,369
his 38 plays have been translated into

991
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,710
50 languages to be or not to be for
