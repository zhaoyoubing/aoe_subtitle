1
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,720
in the last program we looked at the way

2
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,430
in which English had begun to oust

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,379
French is the language of law and

4
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,420
government and how there was a new

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:56,780
confidence in English literature but

6
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,390
during the 14th and 15th centuries there

7
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,460
began a movement to return English to

8
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,030
each central place in society this fight

9
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,910
was often a violent one it was as much a

10
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,979
political story as a linguistic one and

11
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,680
it starts right at the top for late

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,479
medieval Britain was above all a

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,000
religious society the Catholic Church

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,670
controlled and pervaded all aspects of

15
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,039
life and it was in the church that this

16
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,080
struggle for access and power would be

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,050
fought English set out to become the

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:41,370
language of God

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:02:03,470
you

20
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,960
in the beginning was the word and the

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,190
Word was with God and the Word was God

22
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,260
God created the heavens and the earth

23
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,730
now that was formless and empty God said

24
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,990
let there be light and there was light

25
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,850
through him all things were made without

26
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,310
him nothing was made that has been made

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,150
in him was life and that life was the

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,210
light of men

29
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,590
number 12 in your handbook and then

30
00:02:33,590 --> 00:03:04,690
stand up ready to really sing possibly

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,150
in the beginning was the word but not if

32
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,860
you lived in 14th century England and

33
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,260
couldn't speak a Latin power in words

34
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,050
lay in the Bible there was no Bible in

35
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,230
English in formal terms God spoke to the

36
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,230
people in Latin six centuries ago the

37
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,630
Bible stories were commonly enjoyed but

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,940
not the Bible itself to the vast

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:34,819
majority it was a closed book before Zia

and bard as mating there this long

79
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,960
that was the language of the streets

80
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,170
immediate and direct but in God's has

81
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:26,060
Latin ruled

82
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,110
anybody who has brought up in the ways

83
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,970
of the Church of England as iowa's would

84
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,680
find a medieval church service

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
linguistically a strange and remote

86
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,360
affair when you went to church there and

87
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,120
everybody had to was compulsory there

88
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
was no familiar English hymnal hymns

89
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,050
ation and modern or even the Book of

90
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,690
Common Prayer everything was in Latin

91
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,300
and at best you'd only have understood

92
00:06:48,300 --> 00:07:12,000
the odd word of it only the clergy were

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,009
allowed to read the Word of God and they

94
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,940
did even that silently a bell was wrong

95
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,800
to let the congregation know when the

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:35,320
priests had reached the important bits

97
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,000
for the authority of the Catholic Church

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,310
it was vital that a priest and a

99
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,560
language stood between a believer and

100
00:07:42,560 --> 00:08:01,640
the Bible but all that was about to

101
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,520
change dramatically in the 14th century

102
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,620
those the beginnings of a counter

103
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,940
movement that was going to turn

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,490
english-speaking world on its axis it

105
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,260
would eventually tear the church in two

106
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,180
it would mark the end of the Middle Ages

107
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,780
and would cost many many lives it was

108
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,310
the battle for the language of the Bible

109
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,490
the English some of them wanted access

110
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,320
to the kingdom of heaven in the language

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,510
of the streets they wanted a Bible had

112
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,880
belonged to them and they were prepared

113
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,660
to fight for it

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,970
it was the boldest way for English to

115
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,120
become the language of real power the

116
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,030
prime mover was John Wickliffe who at

117
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,040
the age of seventeen was admitted here

118
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:58,420
to Merton College Oxford

119
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:11,670
you

120
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,930
Wickliffe was a charismatic scholar

121
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,000
fluent in Latin and therefore familiar

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,740
with the Bible he was a major

123
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,840
philosopher and theologian who believed

124
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,670
passionately that his knowledge should

125
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,530
be shared by everyone and he was

126
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,240
fiercely opposed to the power and wealth

127
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,790
of the church when men speak of the

128
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,230
church she said they usually mean

129
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,170
priests monks cannons and Friars but it

130
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,630
should not be so whether a hundred

131
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,310
Pope's he wrote and all the Friars

132
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,710
turned to Cardinals their opinions in

133
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,780
matters of faith should not be accepted

134
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,420
except insofar as they're founded on the

135
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,470
scripture itself the church in Wickliffe

136
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,170
style was often lazy and corrupt Bible

137
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,060
reading even among the clergy were

138
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,520
surprisingly rare or often they didn't

139
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,060
have the Latin

140
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,090
when the Bishop of Gloucester surveyed

141
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,010
311 deacons arch deacons and priests of

142
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,170
the diocese he discovered that a hundred

143
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,450
and sixty eight were unable to repeat

144
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,360
the Ten Commandments 31 didn't know

145
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,010
where those commandments came from and

146
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,990
forty couldn't repeat the Lord's Prayer

147
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,460
Wickliffe railed at the corruption and

148
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,160
complacency of the church his overriding

149
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,810
thought was summed up in his passionate

150
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,690
belief in the right of every man whether

151
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,240
cleric or layman to examine the Bible

152
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,080
for himself this meant a full English

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,540
Bible but it wasn't an easy task

154
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,730
it was unauthorized by the church and so

155
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,190
potentially heretical even seditious it

156
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,440
had to be done in secrecy for its aim

157
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,090
was to overthrow the powerful with words

158
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,740
we know that by the beginning of 1380

159
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,810
Wickliffe had organized the translation

160
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,520
from the latin of the first english

161
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,300
bible

162
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,580
the work took place here in Oxford

163
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,370
probably with a number of translators

164
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,470
and it wasn't only the mammoth task of

165
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,780
translation that faced them their Bible

166
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,970
had to be disseminated to

167
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,220
once a translation was done new Bible

script area production lines turning out

170
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,850
handwritten copies

171
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,890
170 of these Bibles survived a huge

172
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,050
number for a 600 year old manuscript

173
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,610
which tells us there must have been

174
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,100
armies of people secretly transcribing

175
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:48,840
it hopping it and passing it all and

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,600
here it is the first English Bible verb

177
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,350
or easily copied out in perfect script

178
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,300
look at it the first thing that strikes

179
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,920
me is how like the Lindisfarne Gospels

180
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,980
it is the tradition went on of this book

181
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,840
you can fairly say it literally changed

182
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,550
the world and later for the sake of this

183
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,040
book hundreds will be martyred dying the

184
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,050
most horrible deaths but this was the

185
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,360
most radical cause of its day one some

186
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,810
sort worth dying for God's word in

187
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:26,560
English here it is in modern speech the

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,950
beginning God made of note heaven and

189
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,970

190
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,420
and darkness were on the face of depth

191
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,390
and the Spirit of God was born on the

192
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:46,210
waters and God said light be made and

193
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,870
light was made and God saw the light

194
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,020
that it was good and he departed the

195
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,710
light fro darkness and he kept the light

196
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,720
day and the darkness night

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,390
and the Eventide and Moreau tide was

198

from the 13/8 days onwards but on the

212
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,870
whole Wickliffe and his team was so in

213
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,030
awe of the sacred nature of the Latin

214
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,010
scriptures that they did a translation

215
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,470
word-for-word even keeping the Latin

216
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,570
word order so it contains phrases like

217
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,240
Lord go from me for I am a man sinner

218
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,610
and I forsooth and the LORD thy God

219
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,430
strong jealous these were people still

220
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,260
nervous with their own language and

221
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,150
shows that it could carry the weight of

222
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,660
God's Word one result was that there are

223
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,030
over a thousand Latin words that turn up

224
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,010
for the first time in English whose use

225
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,050
in English is first recorded in

226
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,730

227
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,340

glory a good word for this Bible this

230
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,990
was still a difficult language to wit

231
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,490
cliffs contemporaries but at least it

232
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,590
wasn't Latin

233
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,390
by the standards of the day it was the

234
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,120
bestseller the church condemned him for

235
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,250
it maintaining that he'd made the

236
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,130
scriptures more open to the readings of

237
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,620
lay men and women thus the jewel of the

238
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,510
clerics is turned to the sport of the

239
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,790
laity and the pearl of the gospel is

240
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,950
scattered abroad and trodden under foot

241
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:20,510
by swine

242
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,820
Wickliffe had begun to organize and

243
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,770
train what amounted to a new religious

244
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,450
order 'but inherent preachers whom he

245
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,040
dispatched around england

246
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,900
the purpose was to spread the word

247
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,810
literally in English it was like a

248
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,880
guerrilla campaign they were determined

249
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,310
to win the battle for God in the

250
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,400
highways byways taverns inns and village

251
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,560
greens they preached against Church

252
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
corruption and proclaimed Wickliffe

253
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
anti-clerical ideas they read from his

254
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,670
English Bible and then became known the

255
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,270
Lollards

256
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,430
the name might be derived from “lollaerd” 

257
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,220
meaning weeds or from "lollen" to whisper

258
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,150
murmur or hum. They were a secret but

259
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,460
influential movement and hated by the

260
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,380
catholic establishment they went

261
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,120
straight to the source of God's teaching

262
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,490
and cut out the priests. Blessed be poor

263
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,850
men in spirit for the kingdom of heaven

264
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,690
is theirs blessed be mild men for they

265
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,350
shall wield the earth blessed be they

266
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,860
that mourn for they shall be comforted

267
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,150
this should be their that hunger and

268
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,280
thirst write wise for they shall be

269
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,670
fulfilled

270
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,880
blessed be merciful men for they shall

271
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,960
get mercy unless it be they that be of

272
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,130
clean heart for they shall see God

273
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,390
blessed be they that suffer persecution

274
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,590
for rightfulness for the kingdom of

275
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,480
heaven is theirs, so shine your light

276
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,570
before men that they see your good works

277
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,170
and glorify your father that is in

278
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,750
heaven

279
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,880
the church wasn't gonna stand for this

280
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,730
it cutted it's very authority on this

spot black friars in London on May the

282
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,480
17th 1382

283
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,090
a special Synod made up of eight bishops

284
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,880
various masters of theology doctors of

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,860
cannon and civil law and forty-five

286
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,740
friars met to examine wit cliffs works

287
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,740
it was a show trial. The conclusion was

288
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,930
preordained and two days into their

289
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,220
meeting they drafted a statement

290
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,350
condemning with cliffs pronouncements as

291
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,610
outright heresies. The Synod also

292
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,760
condemned Wycliffe’ associates (??). It

293
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,530
ordered the arrest and prosecution of

294
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,030
itinerant preachers throughout the land.

295
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,670
Eventually it secured a parliamentary

296
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,700
ban on all english-language Bibles on

297
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,680
the 30th of May that year the Synod

298
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,020
instructed every diocese to publish the

299
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,000
verdict Wickliffe became ill the stress

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,190
defeated him and he was paralyzed by a

301
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,460
stroke

302
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:36,429
two years later he died

303
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,080
Wickliffe death didn't signal the end of

304
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,909
the movement but afterwards lollards

305
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,739
were at constant risk of their lives

306
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,139
they met in hidden places especially in

307
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,909
Hereford and Monmouthshire they managed

308
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,769
to elude the agents of the church and

309
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,169
keep their faith alive one contemporary

310
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,299
chronicler said that every second man he

311
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,489
met was a Lala and they went all over

312
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,830
England luring great Nobles and lords to

313
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,350
their fold it's most unlikely that there

314
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,479
were that numerous but nevertheless this

315
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,970
was a national political movement and

316
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,460
its cause was the English language in

317
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,309
some of say some went soft was the song

318
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,399
he shocked me English food as he sheep

319
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,580
when but in a Meijer morning on Malvern

320
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:26,019
no illness me befell a fairly of fiery

321
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:28,519
this is the West Midlands dialect of

322
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,380
William Langland's Piers Plowman

323
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,410
it's a religious poem the most popular

324
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,830
poem and it's day. It's the first time we

325
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,840
know of but the English language was

326
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,030
used to express a personal Christian

327
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,520
spiritual vision and his evidence of a

328
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,530
native tradition that's a real and

329
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,660
growing alternative for the established

330
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,130
religious culture. Came to Langland in

331
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,480
the series of dreams

332
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
the first here on the Malvern hills  it's

333
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
written in a literate verse. Itself a

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,799
form which harks back to the old english

335
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,169
of Beowulf and it's an allegory of the

336
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,120
Christian life and of the contemporary

337
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,020

English here is being used to form

356
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,279
Magister literal language but one which

357
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,960
is an alternative to the received

358
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,700
authority passed down either through

359
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,720
French or Latin

360
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,659
this is plain speaking a plain folk it

361
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:20,789
seems to say this is real experience

362
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,309
this is the language of an individual

363
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,629
relationship with God.

364
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,850
It prefigures books like pilgrims

365
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,490
progress and Paradise Lost. It would be

366
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,559
stir the Pilgrim Fathers and in good

367
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,840
time become the Protestant language of

368
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,820
the English Reformation. But meanwhile

369
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,799
the church was not satisfied with with

370
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,110
Wycliffe's death it continued to burn Bibles

371
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,450
it burned people and in ordered Wycliffe

372
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,769
to be posthumously burned in 1414 the

373
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,960
most imposing council ever called by the

374
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,970
Catholic Church condemned Wickliffe as a

375
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,610
heretic and in the spring of 1428

376
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,889
ordered his bones to be exhumed and

377
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,649
removed from consecrated ground when the

378
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,809
primate of England looking on wit cliffs

379
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,210
remains were disinterred and burned by a

380
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,039
little bridge that spanned the river

381
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,740
Swift a tributary of the haver

382
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:28,010
his ashes were scattered into the stream

383
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,860
so officially the Bible remained in

384
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,320
Latin but there was a lollard prophecy of

385
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,770
the time which ran: The Avon to the Severn 

386
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,919
runs, The Severn to the sea. And  the waters be.

387
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,740
Wycliffe’s dust shall spread abroad 
Wide as

388
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,470
the waters be. The prophecy was right

389
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,630
English would eventually have its Bible

390
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,850
but the church would not give way before

391
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,040
the new force of English until the state

392
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,090
had buckled first the battle for an

393
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,980
English Bible was a battle literally of

394
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,410
the soul of England but before it could

395
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,660
be won the heart and mind of the country

396
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,030
had to be persuaded to and that process

397
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,780
began here in 1417 in France with Henry

398
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:28,420
the fifth

399
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,130
right trusty and well-beloved brother

400
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,560
right worshipful fathers in God and

401
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,260
trusty and well-beloved for as much as

402
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,420
we know well your desire were to hear

403
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,420
joyful tidings of our good speed we

404
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,000
signify unto you that of our labor has

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,010
sent good conclusion in the early 15th

406
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,840
century Henry was campaigning around

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,730
northern France winning French territory

408
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,410
and famous battles especially dodging

409
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,040
kur it seems a small thing but it was of

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,900
quite extraordinary significance that

411
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,380
after his victory henry v broke with 350

412
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,240
years of royal tradition and wrote his

413
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,520
dispatches home in english this was an

414
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,130
astute move English Kings had begun to

415
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,990
speak English unto his father Henry the

416
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,970
fourth but all court documents had

417
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,920
hitherto been written in French as they

418
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,740
had been since the Norman Conquest

419
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,270
Henry's English letters are deliberate

420
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,400
pieces of propaganda to be spread

421
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,710
throughout the land here's his letter

422
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,360
announcing peace upon Monday the 20th

423
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,210
day of May we arrived in this town tois

424
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,360
and the Accord of the peace perpetual

425
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,550
was here sworn by the Duke of Burgundy

426
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:44,380
and semblable by us in our own name

427
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,539
the letters forthwith sealed under the

428
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,179
Great Seal copies of which we send to be

429
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,190
proclaimed in our city of London and

430
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,590
through all our realm that our people

431
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,419
may have knowledge thereof for their

432
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:59,440
consolation signed Henry by the grace of

433
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,710
God King of England

434
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,150
Henri's motives may have been the

435
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,520
exploitation of anti-french fervor but

436
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,500
once he returned from the campaigns he

437
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,390
continued to write in English and in

438
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,760
doing so he made the first major step

439
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,680
towards the creation of an official

440
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,720
standardized English that everybody

441
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,520
could read. The houses of parliament

442
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,770
where I am now are also called the

443
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,690
Palace of Westminster that's a reminder

444
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,850
that on this site the kings of England

445
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,920
wanted their principal London residence

446
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,530
this Hall is all that survived the Great

447
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,050
Fire and somewhere around here when the

448
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,610
king was in residence would have been

449
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,570
the first circle of his government this

450
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,260
is called the signet office it wrote

451
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,910
personal letters on behalf of the

452
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,680
monarch which carried the Royal Seal and

453
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,500
in ways familiar to us today once Henry

454
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,210
decreed that the signet office should

455
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,670
use English it was inevitable that the

456
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,770
rest of the country would come to do the

457
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,450
same

458
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,910
the problem was which English across the

459
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,950
country people still spoke a mass of

460
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,690
different dialects and would have had

461
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,610
trouble understanding one another for

462
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,280
instance the word "stian" or "stane" in the

463
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,490
north was stone in the south the "ing"

464
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,070
participle as in "running" was said as "and"

465
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,530
in the north and "ende" in the East Midlands

466
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,110
and "inde" in the West Midlands so running

467
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,230
could also be said as "runninde" "runnand" 

468
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,720
and "runnende". But that was nothing

469
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,820
compared to the variety of spellings in

470
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,040
use because England had traditionally

471
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,690
used French or Latin as its written

472
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,730
languages had never been any need to

473
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,860
agree on a common linguistic standard or

474
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,260
even how to spell particular words but

475
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,220
now there was take the word Church for

476
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,840
instance one of the most common and

477
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,030
important in a language in the north of

478
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,830
England it was commonly called a cook

479
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,010
while the South used Church however Kirk

480
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:00,730
could be spelt KYR k KY r ke ke IR ke ke

481
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:07,180
e RK k IRC and ke r ke Church was

482
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,150
variously CH u r CH e CH ER c AG t h ir

483
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,500
CH e CH ER c h CH y RC

484
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:26,040
h CH p RG e g hy r CH e and SC hy r CH e

485
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,120
fortunately from the languages point of

486
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,950
view there was a big engine of state

487
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,810
that could deal with this unruly tongue

488
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,150
it was the chance really reduced the

489
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,890
Chancery the civil service of the day

490
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,900
because it was crucial that a document

491
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,730
produced in London could be read in

492
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,100
Carlisle we needed a common written

493
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:49,780
language this is the public records

494
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,080
office were the official documents of

495
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,700
the 15th century are kept

496
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,340
as Chancery began to use the English

497
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,140
language it had to make hundreds of

498
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,150
decisions about which form of a word on

499
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,490
which spelling to adopt we don't know

500
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,740
how these choices were made but we do

501
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,990
know that they stuck thousands of

502
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,000
documents were painstakingly written out

503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,350
and sent all over the country many had

504
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,930
legal status so they had to be exact and

505
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,160
consistent. And under the influence of

506
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,500
Chancery the language starts to look

507
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,420
more modern and more even words like any

508
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,950
but many not such ought and even I

509
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,470
previously I Chi CH he had also been

510
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,630
allowed find their modern forms at

511
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,810
Chancery lond

512
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,930
becomes land and church Kirk and all the

513
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,250
others become Church during the decade

514
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,050
1469 to 1479

515
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,120
 alone for instance the modern word

516
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,030
shell starts as Excel then shall and

517
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,620
finally settles into its modern form

518
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,580
shall the word arrived becomes right

519
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,170
half and doth become has and does by

520
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,030
fifteen hundred under the influence of

521
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,190
Chancery the language is becoming

522
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,060
recognizable to us

523
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,300
anything else in common with yours

524
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,850
King internet imagine e^x some edge of I

525
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:32,070
and s anyway no why is there a reason

526
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,260
why it will end in different ending it's

527
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,480
just the English language it's a very

528
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,640
good answer okay but just because

529
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,860
everyone began to spell the same way it

530
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,450
didn't mean the language became any more

531
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,310
logical look at this why English is so

532
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,730
hard

533
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,680
we'll begin with the box and the plural

534
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,170
is boxes but the plural of ox is oxen

535
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,110
not boxes so one file is goose butter

536
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:02,520
called geese you may find a lone mouse

537
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,980
or a whole load of mice but the plural

538
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,950
of houses houses not pice if the plural

539
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,610
of man is always and why shouldn't the

540
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,620
plural of pan be cold pen and it goes on

541
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,530
and it goes on and it goes on what's the

542
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,490
poet trying to tell us the English is

543
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,790
confusing hands of you agree with Allah

544
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,660
okay hands down

545
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,420
ask any foreigner in fact ask any pupil

546
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,460
about mastering English spelling and

547
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,900
it's in consistence isn't they'll say

548
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,790
what have we done to deserve this

549
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,640
a lot of it is just to do the mother or

550
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,650
nature of English and a lot of it is to

551
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,180
do with accidents of usage from

552
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,850
centuries ago but some of it was

553
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,160
deliberate hands up if you think that

554
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,170
English is so hard to learn around the

555
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,060
time English was being standardized by

556
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,250
Chancery that was much debate about the

557
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,800
best way to spell things broadly there

558
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,480
were reformers who wanted to spell words

559
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,590
according to the way they were

560
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,600
pronounced and traditionalists who

561
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
wanted to spell them in one of the ways

562
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:08,490
that always be okay the traditionalists

563
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,600
one confusing because silent is fine

564
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,040
they couldn't help tampering though and

565
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,080
a desire to make the route of the

566
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,970
language more evident words that had

567
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,530
ended English from French for instance

568
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,590
were given a Latin look the letter B was

569
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,320
inserted into debt and doubt the letter

570
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,040
C

571
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,020
individuals words that were thought to

572
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,000
be of Greek origin sometimes had their

573
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,520
spelling adjusted so that throne and

574
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,970
theatre acquired their age rhyme on the

575
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,800
other hand was given an age just because

576
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,390
rhythm had one even though it's

577
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,000
etymologically absurd on a similar

578
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,250
principle and L was inserted in court

579
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,410
because it becomes silent but it was

580
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,570
still present ensured and would the same

581
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,580
with h words like "whole" were and

582
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,350
"whelk". unlike anybody who tries to

583
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,570
rationalize English they really messed

584
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,920
it up you feel confused if you just like

585
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,310
me

586
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,530
okay let's carry on it's not going to

587
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,900
look at the second first okay

588
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,620
the cow is a plural maybe mouse or kind,

589
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:18,480
but the plural above is there's not fine

590
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,490
as I see off first and you show me your

591
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:32,020
feet

592
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,140
okay right you can all stand there I've

593
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,980
got the point

594
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,190
let's go as if to prove the folly of

595
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,960
trying to bring reason into the language

596
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,730
the English promptly decided to

597
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,350
pronounce everything differently anyway

598
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,600
around this time and nobody really knows

599
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
why a sea change took place in the way

600
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,490
English sounds this is called the great

601
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,980
vowel shift and in happen comparatively

602
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
quickly we think a generation or two

603
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,330
before it English was pronounced in a

604
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,520
way that sounds foreign to us now "might"

605
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,620
used to sound rather like today's meet

606
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,810
which in turn was said something like

607
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,690
MIT so the sentence I might go and buy

608
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,900
some meat once sounded like I'm eat go

609
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,050
and buy some meat that was the great

610
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,320
vowel shift it made 15th century English

611
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,850
recognizable in the modern era but it

612
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,930
didn't change the spelling what really

613
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,910
gives all languages their uniformity is

614
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,070
of course writing and what gives writing

615
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,290
is huge modern power is the invention

616
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,980
and spread of printing printing was

617
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,040
invented in Gutenberg Germany around

618
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,080
1435 it's often regarded as the most

619
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,420
seismic technological change Western

620
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,900
culture has gone through printing marks

621
00:33:47,900 --> 00:34:14,670
the beginning of the Information Age

622
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,900
it's extraordinary looking at this

623
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,090
simple piece of technology to think of

624
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,220
what a revolution had brought about this

625
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,230
isn't 15th century but it worked in

626
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,720
exactly the same way and because this

627
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,480
device made it easy to manufacture books

628
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,670
in large numbers it became very hard

629
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,740
indeed to control the spread of ideas

630
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,350
and print favored the language of the

631
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:35,830
people

632
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:41,710
English was pressed into service and

633
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,630
although Latin was still the language of

634
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:47,290
religion and scholarship when Caxton

635
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,240
introduced printing to england he got

636
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,060
straight on with making books in english

637
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,860
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Mallory's

638
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,930
tales of King Arthur ways bestsellers

639
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:01,330
but English was still a fluid and

640
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,850
regionally difficult monster and Caxton

641
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,440
worried about how to achieve a common

642
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,480
standard that will be understood and

643
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,580
read by all certainly it is hard to

644
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,240
place everyman because of diversity and

645
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,090
sean's of language for in these days

646
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:22,840
every man will utter his comunicación in

647
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,410
such terms that few man shall understand

648
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,650
today but in my judgment the common

649
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,680
terms that be daily used been lighter to

650
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,140
be understand than the older and on

651
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,670
siient English Caxton tells us that he

652
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,530
is translating Virgil from a French

653
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,270
version but he doesn't know which

654
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,360
English word to use for eggs he tells a

655
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,500
story of some merchants from

656
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,090
Northumberland who are away from home

657
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,910
and visit the house in Kent to buy food

658
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,430
one asks the woman for egg is she tells

659
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,010
him she doesn't speak French another ask

660
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,210
for the same thing with a different

661
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,090
plural errand which means eggs in the

662
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,090
dialect of Kent and he gets them so

663
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,740
which word should Caxton choose for his

664
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,720
translation he settles for egg is

665
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:18,050
and so now do we so it's printers as

666
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,940
much as teachers and writers who decide

667
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,859
on a lot of words and their Spelling's

668
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,140
and although it was writers like Chaucer

669
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,430
and Wickliffe would establish the

670
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,590
dominant dialect it was Caxton's

671
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,750
publications that consolidated the

672
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,000
game's gains which would eventually be

673
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,070
made permanent by the English Bible

674
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,840
which in Tudor times thanks to printing

675
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,750
reached everyone who could read the

676
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,670
scene was set for the creation of

677
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,800
probably the most influential book

678
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,119
that's ever been in the history of

679
00:36:44,119 --> 00:37:06,780
language English or any other

680
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,740
early in the reign of Henry of the

681
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,690
eighth the new king was still promising

682
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,390
the Pope to burn any untrue translations

683
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,849
he meant Wycliffe's Bible relentlessly

684
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,070
circulating in hand-copied editions and

685
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,079
he set his Lord Chancellor Cardinal

686
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,970
Wolsey to hunt down and burn all

687
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,810
heretical books on the 12th of May 1521

688
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,420
a huge bonfire of confiscated heretical

689
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,609
works is made outside the original sand

690
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,890
Paul's Cathedral it was said that the

691
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:37,480
flames burned for two days that same

692
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,820
year a young man who was Oxford educated

693
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,730
and an ordained priest became tutor to a

694
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,589
large household in little Sodbury

695
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,180
Gloucestershire where he started to

696
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,609
preach in the common place called st.

697
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:54,240
Austin's Greene in front of the church

698
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,130
his name was William Tyndale and his

699
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,570
Bible was to bring about a radical

700
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,790
change within the English language and

701
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:05,800
in English society he's had more

702
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,390
influence on the way we speak that

703
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,579
anyone except Shakespeare and he had to

704
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:14,869
leave the country to do it

705
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,730
Tyndale was in the mold of Wickliffe 100

706
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,279
years on to a cleric who challenged him

707
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:23,069
II answered her many years I will cause

708
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,650
a boy that drive the plow to know more

709
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,359
of the scriptures than thou dost you may

710
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,570
say he finished with this business

711
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,180
he believed passionately in an English

712
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,420
fun

713
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,220
in 1524 age 29 Tyndall left England

714
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,130
never to return he settled in Cologne

715
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,900
and began the work of translating the

716
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,790
New Testament into English not from

717
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,070
Latin but from the original Hebrew and

718
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,390
Greek by 1526 6,000 copies had been

719
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,460
printed abroad and were about to be

720
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,210
smuggled into England Henry aids and

721
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,640
Cardinal Wolsey who spies had alerted

722
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,560
them were terrified of this perceived

723
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,260
threat and the whole country was put on

724
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,920
alert naval ships patrolled the coastal

725
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,140
waters boats were stopped and searched

726
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,030
and a great many of the Bibles were

727
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,250
intercepted for the state this was a

728
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,380
serious struggle Latin was the language

729
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,690
not only of God but the state's

730
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,300
authority arrested on it too the enemy

731
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,730
had to be beaten off an enemy that would

732
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,530
eventually give the English language so

733
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,010
magnificently to the English people

734
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,840
but first tens and then hundreds of

735
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,910
these Bibles began to get through the

736
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,890
Bishop of London tried a love attack he

737
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,080
sought to buy the entire print run

738
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,120
through an intermediary oh he will burn

739
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,680
them Tyndale the submersed have said

740
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,600
when he heard this well I am the gladder

741
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,430
but I shall get the money of him for

742
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,500
these books and the whole world for cry

743
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,220
out upon the burning of God's Word and

744
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,900
that's what happened the bishop bought

745
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,540
and burnt his books and Tyndall used the

746
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,980
money to prepare and print a better

747
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,620
version at Church expense and this is

748
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,900
what the conflict was about a Bible for

749
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,440
the people in their spoken language

750
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,200
blessed are the poor in spirit for

751
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,130
theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed

752
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,720
be they that mourn for they shall be

753
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,170
comforted blessed are the meek for they

754
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,780
shall inherit the earth

755
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,370
blessed are they which hunger and thirst

756
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,140
for righteousness for they shall be

757
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,830
filled

758
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,470
blessed are the merciful for they shall

759
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,260
obtain mercy blessed are the pure in

760
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,160
heart for they shall see God

761
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,320
blessed are the peacemakers for they

762
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,190
shall be called the children of God

763
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,600
blessed are they which suffer

764
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,870
persecution for righteousness sake for

765
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,080
theirs is the kingdom of heaven ye are

766
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,920
the salt of the earth it's hard it's

767
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,380
impossible to overpraise the quality of

768
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,660
Tyndall's writing its rhythmical beauty

769
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,120
its simplicity of phrase has penetrated

770
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,040
deep into the bedrock of english as we

771
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,940
still know today Tyndall's work form 85%

772
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,980
of the later King James Bible the one we

773
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,380
all know and we all use his phrase is

774
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,970
still scapegoat

775
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,730
let there be light the powers that be my

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,380
but the flesh is weak sign of the times

781
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,450
ye of little faith eat drink and be

782
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,490
merry brokenhearted clear-eyed and

783
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,310
hundreds and hundreds more words like

Passover come to us from Tyndale by this

788
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,220
stage in the adventure of English we're

789
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,350
coming across words that carry our ideas

790
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,330
and emotions and feelings even today

791
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,610
words that not only tell us about the

792
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,770
external world we live in but about the

793
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,180
inner nature of our condition then God

794
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,620
said let there be light

795
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,130
and God saw the light and that it was

796
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,100
good and he divided the light from the

797
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,290
darkness and called the light day and

798
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,790
the darkness night and so of the evening

799
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:30,010
and morning was made the first day

800
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,119
before long there were thousands of

801
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,859
copies of Tyndall's Bible in England in

802
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:36,320
his happy phrase the noise of the new

803
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,079
Bible echoed throughout the country

804
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,460
produced in a small pocket-sized

805
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,740
addition that was easily concealed it

806
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,060
passed through the cities and

807
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,800
universities into the hands of even the

808
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,950
humblest men and women the authorities

809
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,530
especially Thomas More still railed

810
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,810
against him for putting the fire of

811
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,700
Scripture into the language of our

812
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,420
bodies but the damage was done the

813
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,089
English had their English Bible legal or

814
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:05,660
not

815
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,270
the hunt for $10 continued viable in

816
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,390
1535 to hide assassins and trapped him

817
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,490
in Andhra and smuggled him out of the

818
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,770
city to Vil vodka cell where he was

819
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,730
imprisoned in his last letter Tyndall

820
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,640
asked that he might have a warmer cap

821
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,270
for I suffer greatly from the cold a

822
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,340
warmer coat also for what I have is very

823
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,860
thin a piece of cloth with which to

824
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,380
patch my leggings and I asked to be

825
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,000
allowed to have a lamp in the evening

826
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,370
for it is wearisome to sit alone in the

827
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,640
dark but most of all I beg and beseech

828
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,010
your clemency that the commissary will

829
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,350
kindly permit me to have my Hebrew Bible

830
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,930
grammar and dictionary a time I continue

831
00:43:48,930 --> 00:44:05,890
with my work.

832
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,000
And continued his work he did phrases

833
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,160
like a prophet has no honor in his own

834
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,700
country a stranger in a strange land a

835
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,839
law unto themselves we live and move and

836
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,290
have our being and let my people go all

837
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:32,660
come from Tyndall's pen. In August 1536

838
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,210
Tindall was found guilty of heresy by a

839
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,480
court in the Netherlands and on October

840
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,270
the 6th he was strangled then burned at

841
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,450
the stake his last words were Lord

842
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:52,520
opened the king of England's eyes in

843
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,890
fact events had already opened the Kings

844
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,869
eyes Henry the Eighth had tried to

845
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,910
divorce Catherine of Aragon and that had

846
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,500
brought him into confrontation with the

847
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,290
Pope now he too was opposed to papal

848
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,109
supremacy Henry's mood had changed and

849
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:08,900
scripture was suddenly more important in

850
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,749
church authority

851
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:15,249
Thomas Moore had been executed for

852
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:17,910
refusing to see things the Kings way and

853
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,650
his new advisors Thomas Cromwell and

854
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,869
Thomas Cranmer keen to keep their heads

855
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:27,550
moved on ecclesiastical reform

856
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:31,160
and that reform came with the split from

857
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,590
Rome and the English Reformation now

858
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,510
England needed the scriptures to be

859
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,790
available in its own tongue English was

860
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,130
to become at last the language of power

861
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,800
Henry's change of mind came too late to

862
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,660
save Tyndall even supposing he gave his

863
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,060
fate any thought at all but by the time

864
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,100
of Tyndall's martyrdom Henry had already

865
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,860
authorized this Coverdale Bible which

866
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,540
was translated from the German and was

867
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,430
the first legal Bible in England that

868
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,600
was in 1535 in 1537 Matthew's Bible and

869
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,880
amalgam of covered airs and Kindles was

870
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,550
allowed to be printed in England in 1539

871
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,130
we have the great Bible designs to be

872
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,510
the official version for newly

873
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,340
Protestant England and to be placed in

874
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,890
every parish church in the land after

875
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,320
centuries of suppression three Bibles

876
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,720
are approved and published inside six

877
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,910
years and he goes on the Geneva Bible

878
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,960
the bishops Bible the Rheims Bible the

879
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,610
English language has suddenly flowered

880
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,770
it's already returned to the palaces of

881
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,600
Port and state like this one Lambeth

882
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,760
Palace in London it's again become the

883
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,260
language of a vivid and vigorous

884
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,450
national literature and now with the

885
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,910
split from Rome its Concord the last and

886
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:43,190
highest Bastion the church it was the

887
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,290
spirit of Protestantism that the Bible

888
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,980
be available to everyone in 1530 thomas

889
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,810
moore had ranted about the shame of it

890
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,160
being read by Plowboys

891
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,340
but the great Bible of 1540 came with a

892
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,770
preface by more successive farmer which

893
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,359
commended it to all

894
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,529
here may men wing young old learn and

895
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:07,769
unlearn at rich or priests lame and

896
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,440
Lords ladies officers tenants and mean

897
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,559
men virgins wives widows lawyers

898
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:16,680
merchants artifices husbands and all

899
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,450
manner of persons of what a state or

900
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,880
conditions however they be learn all

901
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,089
things what they ought to believe what

902
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:27,089
they ought to do as well as concerning

903
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:31,220
Almighty God as themselves all others

904
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,069
and so we've come full circle where the

905
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,200
medieval Catholic Church kept the Bible

906
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,299
from the people Henry's new church set

907
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:40,950
out to get the Bible to as many people

908
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,319
as possible it's had an extraordinary

909
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,269
influence on the spread of our language

910
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,009
by the end of the sixteenth century

911
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:49,289
there were so many competing versions

912
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:51,420
that King James the first ordered a

913
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,220
standardized version which we now know

914
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,519
as a King James Bible of 1611 the

915
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:57,839
writers drew on all the previous

916
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,799
versions but mostly on Tyndall's

917
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,390
interestingly they made no attempt to

918
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,249
update the language that was now 80

919
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,910
years old so even though by 1611 English

920
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,069
had undergone further revolution the

921
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:12,869
King James translators would still use

922
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:16,440
room sometimes for you as in ye cannot

923
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,839
serve God and Mammon even though nobody

924
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,640
said ye in common speech anymore

925
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,079
they use thou for you gut forgot spake

926
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:31,160
for spoke and so on

927
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,259
in other words the King James Version

928
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:35,630
was deliberately archaic even then and

929
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,489
that's part of its extraordinary power

930
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:40,489
it was designed to feel as if it had the

931
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:42,499
authority and resonance of speech from

932
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:44,869
the past it was meant to sound ancient

933
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:57,790
antique like the very words of God

934
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,280
and above all the men who made this

935
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,890
version listened to their final drafts

936
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,680
being read aloud over and over again and

937
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,210
altered them accordingly

938
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,400
so that they had the right rhythm and

939
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,090
balance

940
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,000
this makes the authorized English Bible

941
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,060
par excellence a preachers Bible it was

942
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,760
written to be spoken to be heard to be

943
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,720
understood it was written to spread the

944
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,440
word English at last had got on its side

945
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,020
the language was authorized by the

946
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,340
Almighty Himself in the beginning was

947
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,340
the word and the Word was with God and

948
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,620
the Word was God

949
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,440
the same was in the beginning with God

950
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,360
all things were made by him and without

951
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,010
him was not anything made that was made

952
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,290
in him was life and the life was the

953
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,200
light of men and the light shine earth

954
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,030
in darkness and the darkness

955
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,540
comprehended it not and the Word was

956
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:35,030
made flesh and dwelt among us

957
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,090
you
