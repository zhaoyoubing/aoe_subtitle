1
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,270
this is the story of how British

2
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,250
interests abroad spread the English

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,260
language and now it was changed and

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,439
recharged bytes foreign adventures in

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:44,969
India in the Caribbean so why do you

6
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,289
have to the right on this part and I

7
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,149
said to myself like you know he can make

8
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:57,239
some money here and in Australia the

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,250
forces of empire spread English around

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,100
the globe whatever the rights wrongs of

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,470
this drive he could truly be claimed but

12
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,270
the Sun never set on the English

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,909
language as it spread it gave birth to

14
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,890
new English's and they became locked in

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,780
battles for power and prestige with the

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,909
mother tongue new English's became a

17
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,310
source of pride for some have shame for

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,680
others a conflict of liberation even a

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,780
Brotherhood and one outcome is

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,450
indisputable the English language was

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:57,020
enriched immeasurably

22
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,030
in India English faced a country of

23
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,420
intense and elaborate civilizations a

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,890
magnificent Empire initially much

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,500
greater than its own and it faced an

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
enormous challenge if it was to

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,530
establish itself in a country which

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,720
today boasts over a thousand million

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,180
people and 200 different languages

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,280
including Hindi Sanskrit Bengali

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,800
Gujarati Marathi Punjabi Kashmiri and

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,370
Rudra but establish yourself it did and

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,620
here in Calcutta the signs are still

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:46,890
literally all around

35
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,810
we gave English words to India and some

36
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,670
words from our experience in India have

37
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,830
fed back into English most of them from

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,620
Hindi familiar words like Blighty Mangal

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,460

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,380
many more were adopted from the

48
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:35,110
subcontinent

49
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,060
trade contacts through the early middle

50
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,070
ages what the first words from Asia into

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,690
the English language often through Latin

52
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,490
or Greek which absorbed them and passed

53
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,580
them on words like pepper barrel ginger

54
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,150
Panther sugar musk sand or camphor and

55
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,100
opal all seem to have their roots in

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,140
languages spoken on the subcontinent and

57
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,450
especially in Sanskrit

58
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,250
but the close relationship between

59
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,560
English in India really began at the

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,290
start of the 17th century when the East

61
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,209
India Company was granted a monopoly

62
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,940
charter to seek out and trade with the

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,489
rich spice markets of East this was a

64
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,930
collision of cultures between the

65
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,790
British merchant adventurers and the

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,430
potentates of Oriental society and in

67
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,380
order to prosper the English had to

68
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,600
learn a lexicon of power and degree and

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,570
to curry favor obsequious this matter

70
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,210
the English at that time were amateurs

71
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,979
in class and social distinctions

72
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,139
compared to the culture which included

73
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,400
Maharaja Mandarin nabob cha mogul con

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,669
Raja padishah lama sage Santana and

75
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,580
Maharani the English at the kowtow and

76
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,310
learn Bengali and Hindi to survive and

77
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,700
they did in India after years of

78
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,490
negotiation begging and buttering up the

79
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,229
Mughal rulers in their own Persian

80
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,060
tongue they were allowed to set up

81
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,910
trading posts factories at Madras Bombay

82
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:13,180
and amid the opulence of sure

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,770
at the end of the 17th century the

84
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,900
English established another factory here

85
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,490
in tiny village on the banks of the

86
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,409
river Hugoton which would become one of

87
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,210
the world's greatest trading cities

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,150
Calcutta what brought the English to

89
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,740
India was a commodity that they could

90
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,419
turn a profit on around the markets of

91
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,520
the East a commodity that India was

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,980
famous for then and now

93
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,800
in India the English found a variety of

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,420
brightly colored printed and woven

95
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:50,230
fabrics delicate Muslims chinses calicos

96
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,600
and gingham

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,250
when these reach Britain they became an

98
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,170
instant success and their names as

99
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:16,370
familiar as they are today

100
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,530
India and Britain it was the start of a

101
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,409
relationship that would be enduring

102
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,060
passionate and often mired by

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,509
misunderstanding and violence

104
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,190
English had planted his foot firmly on

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,500
Indian soil but if it hardly announced

106
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,599
its presence with a fanfare the East

107
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,060
India Company prospered but in this vast

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,220
country its english-speaking employees

109
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,870
were numbered in hundreds not thousands

110
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,849
some of the senior employees were

111
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,039
encouraged to go native take a little

112
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,530
wives and adopt a local habits and dress

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,770
and when they wanted to conduct business

114
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,000
they had to learn the local languages

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,409
for most British errs this was a matter

116
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,930
of commercial necessity but there were

117
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,000
others who knew most scholarly interest

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,219
in India's languages one of these

119
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,719
British students of the Orient

120
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,639
made a discovery which rewrote the

121
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,069
history of the English language English

122
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,139
traced its roots back to the dialects of

123
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,969
the Germanic invaders from frizzier in

124
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,949
the 5th century as we did at the start

125
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,740
of this series but no further

126
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,440
but in 1784 William Jones who was in

127
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,870
India in its capacity as Supreme Court

128
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,599
Judge founded the Asiatic Society of

129
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,360
Bengal to encourage inquiry into the

130
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,909
history civil unnatural the antiquities

131
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,029
arts sciences and literature of Asia and

132
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,400
when Jones started to look at the

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,860
ancient language of Sanskrit a language

134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,180
written down two or three centuries

135
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,639
before the Iliad and the Odyssey he

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,409
discovered what was effectively the

137
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,210
prequel of the adventure of English

138
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,129
he discovered that one of the deepest

139
00:07:53,129 --> 00:08:00,840
roots of English was here in India Jones

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,270
made the startling discovery that there

141
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,979
were similarities between words in

142
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,169
Sanskrit and a younger language is a

that they were all descended from one

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,519
indo-european language and his work was

159
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,920
the foundation of modern philology the

160

study of languages

161
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,470
English had acquired a new past here at

162
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,220
the headquarters of the Asiatic Society

163
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,780
it was just one of the new buildings

164
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,670
with which the British were reshaping

Calcutta by 1765 the balance of power

166

had shifted the Mughal empires had

167
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,340
collapsed and the East India Company

took over the administration and

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,130
colonial capital a center of commercial

172
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,740
political and social life here the

173
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,570
relationship between Indian and British

174
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,490
became one of servant and master a

175
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,540
dangerous climate of feeling was

176
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,580
developing that it was a duty and

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,710
destiny of the British to govern in

178
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,350
India they were no longer going native

179
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,660
marrying Indian women adopting Indian

180
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,550
customs and learning local languages

181
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,520
they began to see themselves as superior

182
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,920
to the native population and the essence

183
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:09,420
of their superiority was their religion

184
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,430
in 1830 in the Foreign Secretary William

185
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,110
Wilberforce told the British Parliament

186
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,180
that they were morally obliged to change

187
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,760
what he called India's dark and bloody

188
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,340
superstition from the genial influence

189
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,990
of Christian light and truth

190
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,180
the British had looked at India and had

191
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,040
decided that the Indians just run

192
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,560
foolish enough in the interest of their

193
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,910
happiness and for the good of their

194
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,040
souls they needed to be converted to

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,800
Christianity and Western morals a string

196
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,240
of missionaries headed east to devote

197
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,490
themselves to this work in order to

198
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,260
teach their religion they set up schools

199
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,510
and they taught not in the languages of

200
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:49,990
India but in English there were Indians

201
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,820
who welcomed the establishment of

202
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,550
English language education recognizing

203
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,740
that it could give India access to

204
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,720
modern Western thought and scientific

205
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,490
knowledge but what happened next went

206
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,100
beyond education a new english-language

207
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,710
policy changed Indian society and its

208
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,020
relationship with the British forever in

209
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,600
1835 thomas babington macaulay writer

210
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,610
and member of the supreme council in

211
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,590
calcutta wrote his famous or infamous

212
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,650
minute in it he laid out why he thought

213
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,080
the teaching of English rather than any

214
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,270
Indian language should become official

215
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,180
government policy he summed up the

216
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,800
dialects commonly spoken among the

217
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,080
natives of this part of India contained

218
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,730
neither literary nor scientific

219
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,970
information and are moreover so poor and

220
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,160
rude that it will not be easy to

221
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
translate any valuable work into them

222
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,900
the claims of our own language it is

223
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,900
hardly necessary to recapitulate it

224
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,940
stands preeminent even among the

225
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,310
languages of the West I think it clear

226
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,410
that it is possible to make natives of

227
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,630
this country perfectly good English

228
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,690
scholars and to this end our effort

229
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,710
ought to be directed

230
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,090
today that sounds astonishingly

231
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,310
patronizing it sounded to the many at

232
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,860
the time English would be the Imperial

233
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,020
language of India there were some who

234
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,270
welcomed it and saw it as a window to a

235
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,880
bigger world and they still do others

236
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,710
who resented it as an intolerable

237
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,380
imposition and they still do this

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,810
English education would only ever be for

239
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,150
a minority of immigrants the core is

240
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,550
intention in creating these good English

241
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,590
scholars was to create a new class of

242
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,210
Indians whose knowledge of the English

243
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,670
language and ideas would make them loyal

244
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,800
to their colonial rulers the class who

245
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,200
he said would be interpreters between a

246
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,300
few thousand British in India and the

247
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,490
million was from their government these

248
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,140
were the cloths of the Indian Civil

249
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,020
Service who are now here as writers this

250
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,330
huge building behind me the writers

251
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,520
building was constructed to house them

252
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,980
from here hundreds of thousands of

253
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,780
instructions dealing in law finance

254
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,400
health Commerce and the nuts and bolts

255
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,260
of government were issued in English

256
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,600
from here the British through English

257
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,440
ran India

258
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,110
as the 19th century progressed the vast

259
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,300
continent was opened up British

260
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,790
colonizers engineers surveyors doctors

261
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,950

adventure British civil servants working

263
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,030
with their english-speaking Indian

writers administrative

265
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,970
without the english-speaking bureaucracy

266
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,370
there have been no Raj a word meaning

267
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,800
rule or Kingdom taken from the Hindi

268
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
English was institutionalized now in

269
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,779
India it was part of the fabric of

270
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,490
government it was the language of

271
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,680
preference the language of prestige and

272
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,350
English as often was changed by this

encounter I stand under the shoes of my

274
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,139
client and only seek to place my bone of

275
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,930
contention clearly in over time the

276
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,910
English spoken by Indians became a

277
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,769
particular ornate form

278
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:09,170
Babu English she was called your honor

279
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,870

my client is a widow a poor chap with

told by Indian to Indian with no British

283
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,550
here to check its proliferation of

284
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,980
florid phrases their relationship is

285
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,250
only homeopathic so the misty arguments

286
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,720
of my learned friend will not hold water

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,579
the English spoken by the British also

288
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,620
changed the district officers

289
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,300
magistrates and other officials who

290
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,160
toured the country attending the Raj

291
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,790
picked up Indian words by the bushel and

292
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,990
incorporated them into their daily

293
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:54,190
speech

294
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,660
the British Army particularly relish

295
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,220
picking up Indian words they pride

296
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,170

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,740
to the eyeballs stoned on bang in which

300
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,390

Hindi words for a little later the slang

305
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,120
was so prolific but it needed a

306
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,110
dictionary in 1886 this great glossary

307
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,180
of Anglo Indian colloquial words and

308
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,000

dust coloured meaning a light Brad cloth

312
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,750
the dictionary notes that it is said

313
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,670
that it is about to be introduced into

314
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,980
the army generally the dictionary has

315
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,380
the curious type of Hobson Jobson as the

316
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,420
book explains this is another army term

317
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,339
a corruption of a phrase shuttered by

318
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,529
Muslims in a procession there are plenty

319
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,000
more examples of the way that the

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,920
British had adopted an altered Indian

321
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,260
words chapatti entered the English

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,390
echo of Patti or even a cow Pat pushing

324
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,699
it that way the Indian plant carriage

325
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,890
which as irritating hairs became courage

326
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,709
and the fish Kaka became cock-up

327
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,930
Allahabad became known as I love bats

buzzy karna stale food or yesterday's

333
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,420
whenever they could

334
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,520
the British fled the threat of corporal

335
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,290
Forbes and the heat and dust of the

336
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,880
plains in summer and took to the hills

337
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,410
in and around Hill stations like

338

Darjeeling army officers civil servants

339
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,240
and tea planters built a little England

340
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,100
where they could take Tiffin on the

341
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,530
veranda with their mem Symes or sip a

342
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,350
chota peg as the Sun went down

343
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,700
the British shall become comfortable

344
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,010
with India and English comfortable with

345
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:23,770
its Indian but while English enjoyed

346
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,480
that minion the seeds of Indian

347
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,880
nationalism were being sown in meetings

348
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,790
in this room and rumours alike it by the

349
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,800
pioneers of Indian independence used to

350
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,900
gather Niro himself the young Niro used

351
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,710
to come to this room

352
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,140
this was the unlooked-for fruit of

353
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,880
Macaulay's minute and the education

354
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,260
policy that had brought the english

355
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,630
language to the indian people as well as

356
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,820
words they'd taken on ideas Western

357
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,710
ideas of democracy self-government and

358
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,230
freedom and English are not only given

359
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,090
them the theory it had given them the

360
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,750
language to communicate it to the world

361
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,430
Rudyard Kipling noted that many Indians

362
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,170
claimed that they could run their own

363
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,450
country and that some Englishman

364
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,370
believed them but only because the

365
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,230
Indians put that case in what he called

366
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,750
beautiful English which made it sound

367
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,570
credible Kipling dismissed Indian

368
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,160
independence is no more than a pretty

369
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,460
idea but it was more it was persistent

370
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,220
the English language had inadvertently

371
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,260
sowed the seeds of the destruction of

372
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,230
the Raj the British didn't see it coming

373
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,400
when the Viceroy Lord Curzon

374
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
choreographed a spectacular durbar to

375
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,300
celebrate the accession of Edward the

376
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,990
seventh in 1903 India was still the

377
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,700
jewel in the crown of the British Empire

378
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,090
and what or who could possibly dislodge

379
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,870
it

380
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,720
five years later one of the leaders of

381
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,730
the independence movement a lawyer

382
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,130
called ma Hindus K Gandhi wrote a

383
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,200
pamphlet in which he complained about

384
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,270
the imperial status of the English

385
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,390
language in India to give millions a

386
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,250
knowledge of English is to enslave them

387
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,620
the foundation that macaulay laid of

388
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Education has enslaved us I do not

389
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,320
suggest that he had any such intention

390
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,380
but that has been the result is it not a

391
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,390
sad commentary that we should have to

392
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,600
speak of home rule in a foreign tongue

393
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,090
what's fascinating is the idea that a

394
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,279
language can enslave a people

395
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,710
the British didn't much have slavery on

396
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,840
their minds at that time what concerned

397
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,450
em was building a new symbolic capital

398
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,100
more than a thousand miles away from

399
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,259
here to be designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens

400
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,590
a New Delhi but they still taken an

401
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,779
interest in Indian languages and customs

402
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,970
they might have come across the proverb

403
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,100
which said that anybody who tried to

404
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,409
build a new capital of Delhi was doomed

405
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:49,440
it had happened six times already it

406
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,809
happened to the Raj the rise would be

407
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,820
lost and with that loss would come a

408
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,299
move to oust English from India

409
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:09,470
altogether

410
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,090
we came to the island of the Campbells

411
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,910
called Dominica where we arrived the 9th

412
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,220
of March near about this place inhabited

413
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,880
certain Indians who came down to us

414
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,220
presented mill and cakes of bread which

415
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,500
they had made from a kind of corn called

416
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,549
maize and they brought us down hens

417
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,669
Pines and potatoes these potatoes be the

418
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:40,919
most delicate roots that maybe even the

419
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,809
natives from Hawkins called Indians I

420
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,429
mean given that name by Christopher

421
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,970
Columbus in 1492 he thought he'd found a

422
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,010
Western route to India but he had in

423
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,130
fact made landfall here 12,000 miles to

424
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,710
the east in the Caribbean another stage

425
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,690
on which the adventure of English will

426
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,789
be played out the name Caribbean itself

427
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,710
which denotes the Great Sea and the arc

428
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,270
of islands which string out for more

429
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,970
than 1500 miles

430
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,740
the real name of one of the native

431
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,290
tribes here the carriers who notorious

432
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,940
for their fierceness and cruel treatment

433
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,160
of captives another version of their

434
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,380
name was Cali from which we get our word

435
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,010
and the Carib languages gave English

436
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,650
caiman canoe Farrar a peccary and

437
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,660
tamarind among other words from the

438
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,100
language of another local tribe the

439
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,800
arrow axe came hurricane cassava guava

440
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,710
hammock iguana and Savannah two words

441
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,290
used by Hawkins maize and potato and

442
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,260
mangrove barbecue probably and Jamaica

443
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:47,000
itself it soaked up new words but the

444
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,770
adventure here in the Caribbean is very

445
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,690
different from the one in India their

446
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,850
English initially at least it had to

447
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,500
accommodate itself to establish

448
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,890
languages spoken by people with status

449
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,750
in the Caribbean local people and local

450
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,240
languages would be pushed aside others

451
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,130
would be important and they would react

452
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,630
with English and other European

453
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,790
languages to produce rich and unique

454
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:14,110
fibers

455
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,549
English interest in the region had begun

456
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,559
with attempts to hijack Spanish treasure

457
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,669
ships by Drake

458
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,530
Hawkins and others with the unofficial

459
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,429
approval of Queen Elizabeth

460
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:27,679
we were pirates and pirate tales were as

461
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
popular then as now by the time Daniel

462
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,900
Defoe wrote his history of pirates in

463
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,929
1724 words from their exotic and

464
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,700
bloodthirsty world had already entered

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,850
nations hiding out in fortified bases

470
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,090
they set up throughout the Caribbean

471
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,470
the Buccaneers were eventually flushed

472
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,120
out of their strongholds like this one

473
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,920
at Port Royal in Jamaica the future

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,170
belonged to other opportunists the

475
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,060
colonists who had already begun the

476
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,830
systematic exploitation of the Caribbean

477
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,880
where the Caribbean and the Atlantic

478
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,400
Ocean meet lie the tiny islands of

479
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,090
Nevison Saint Kitts British settlement

480
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,550
of the Caribbean began here at Sandy Bay

481
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:30,080
in 1624 the first thing the settlers did

482
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,330
was to drive the local carry people off

483
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,830
the island

484
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,420
the mainly English settlers at first

485
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,450
grew tobacco then switched to the more

486
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,020
lucrative crop of sugarcane they needed

487
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,580
a laborer to work in the fields and

488
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,270
mills soon they were importing slaves

489
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,430
from Africa slaves who picked up English

490
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,470
words from sailors on the ships that

491
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,360
brought them over and from the British

492
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,040
on the plantations the English that was

493
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,140
spoken on sent kids took different forms

494
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,850
there were many British servants and

495
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,590
laborers and they spoke in their own

496
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,840
regional dialects but those further up

497
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,610
the social ladder the landowners and

498
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,470
their managers aspire to something more

499
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,020
refined one 18th century plantation

500
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,150
manager called James Granger put these

501
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,610
aspirations into writing in an epic poem

502
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:26,970
in praise of the sugarcane

503
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,550
what's oil the cane affects what care

504
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,910

English at its best whatever its

512
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,140
qualities it was a world away from the

513
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,030
language spoken by the majority on st.

Kitts that sable progeny of Africa as

Grainger coyly puts it the black slaves

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,440
who now at numbered the white settlers a

517
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,870
taste of their language was recorded by

518
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,179
an English carpenter Samuel Matthews in

519
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,580
the last decade of the 18th century on

520
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,350
st. Kitts he wrote down the following

exchange a darker version of plantation

522
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,120

523
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,640
we might get to the authentic voice of a

524
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:34,750
slave vast matter but equal a brioche a

525
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,440
volume you tell us about all the bottom

526
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,920
and go wrong your body flow what's the

527
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,429

528
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:46,210

529
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,970
you don't stand in the hall that white

530
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:54,070
man is going to this is language it

531
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,559
shows the speaker's African origins most

532
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,150
of the words in this short passage I

533
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,730
recognizable in English on the page but

534
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,679
the sounds have shifted brother has

535
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,600
become buddy a word that's now very

536
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,490
familiar but this is the first time it

537
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,100
was recorded overseer has become OBC

538
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,170
this is what happens when people try to

539
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,480
voice strange words using the sounds

540
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,429
that they know we've seen it before in

541
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:16,870
America when the Pilgrim Fathers

542
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,059
struggled with Native American words

543
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,550
there's another example here the English

544
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,460
word stan has become tan that's probably

545
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,170
because a lot of African languages don't

546
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,660
allow two consonants to run together so

547
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,350
the STS Stan has become T and the nd has

548
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,539
become n stand

549
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,029
English vocabulary African grammar

550
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,249
there's one word straight from Africa

551
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,499
Bhakra for European or white man and

552
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,119
another has come through Portuguese

553
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,699
slave traders their words Savin as here

554
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:49,209
becomes so be to know you turn the

555

sorbitol the bokram and go wrong your

556
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,999
body for this kind of language is called

557
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,789
a creole it's the result of African and

558
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,009
European languages colliding producing

559
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,729
hybrids spoken by the black population

560
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:04,449
Lemmy lon

561
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:08,559
not such trouble begin no you mind tic

von Thal some knock your rotten this was

563
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:12,940
the pattern throughout the plantations

564
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,549
of the Caribbean but on each Island the

565
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:17,469
social and racial mix was slightly

566
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,719
different and each Island developed its

567
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:25,389
own unique Creole unfortunately English

568
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:27,159
wasn't a benign parent to what is

569
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,869
regarded as it's rather uncouth

570
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,659
offspring the Creoles continued to be

571
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:33,999
treated by English speakers as unfit for

572
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,049
polite society

573
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:37,329
this pressure meant that some Creole

574
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:38,919
speakers tried to gentrify their

575
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:40,839
language to sound more like the standard

576
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,759
English speaking social elite so

577
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,769
throughout the Caribbean that wasn't

578
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,659
just a division into two languages with

579
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,399
standard English at one end of society

580
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,529
and deep prayer at the other there was a

581
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,869
whole set of variations across society

582
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,119
but however many variations there were

583
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,579
standard English was treated as superior

584
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,459
at least by white speakers the original

585
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:01,599
inhabitants of the island had been

586
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,599
cleared by brute force of disease

587
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,919
English had moved in with the settlers

588
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,049
and now it had dominion over the other

589
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,659
forms of languages did it spawn at least

590
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:18,850
for the time being

591
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,590
wherever English traveled around the

592
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,620
globe the story was the same new

593
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,659
colonies developed dialects of their own

594
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:28,059
even when no other foreign languages

595
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:34,600
were involved

596
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,120
in January 1788 a fleet of 11 ships

597
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,130
commanded by captain Arthur Phillip

598
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,680
sailed gingerly between these headlands

599
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,230
after eight months at sea to make a

600
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,300
landfall in the country which would

601
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:53,330
become Australian place they chose to

602
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,350
settle would become Sydney Harbor today

603
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,360
the ferries which transport Sydney's

604
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,340
commuters by the names of the ships of

605
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,980

615
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,720
the next 80 years over 150 thousand

616
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,310
convicts were transported to Australia

617
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,060
at Botany Bay the hulks and the jail's

618
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,270

the jails are 10,000 times more

620
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,170
the British saw this as unsettled land

621
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,650
but of course it was peopled by native

622
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,040
Australians the Aboriginal tribes had

623
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,550
over 250 languages many would disappear

624
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,059
over time but in the early days the

625
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,890
settlers were fascinated by the natives

626
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,050
and from them they learned the names for

627
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,940
many of the new plants and animals they

628
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,220
are encountering like the kangaroo

629
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,510
English picked up more words from the

630
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,250
native languages around Sydney Harbour

631
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,970
boomerang bingo Cola wallaby wallow Roo

632
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,090
and wombat and Kui which was a call used

633
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,800
by natives to summon one another from a

634
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,929
distance was soon adopted by the English

635
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,090
and there's also a type of owl called

636

the boo book a tree called owatta which

637

Australian English developed its own

character which it quickly did it came

649
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,400

criminal background of the early

654
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,750
settlers some words that we think are

655
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,460
most typically Australian were actually

656

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,340
for work and fair dinkum meant something

661
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,590
similar to Fairplay and Digger was

662
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,120
another word that sail halfway around

the world English then Australian now

664
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:44,770
the new Australians got their most

665
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,540
colorful vocabulary from the criminal

666
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,309
slang of 18th century London which was

667
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,980
known as flash or kiddie talk kiddy from

668
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,720

00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,210
the image of the Australian bush man and

718
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:07,270
his speech in the outback once a jolly

Potence Lister Banjo Paterson in 1895

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,770
Australian English at the time and in

734
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,570
the figure of the swagman who'd rather

735
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,150
die than be taken prisoner it captures

736
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,680
an attitude a contempt for authority

737
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:22,470
which will become a national try

738
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,270
but while the Australian vocabulary grew

739
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,059
when Australian phrases were coined

740
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,440
Australian English didn't get official

741
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,099
respectability in 1926 the director of

742
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,410
education in New South Wales could still

743
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,130
write it is said to reflect that other

744
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,500
people are able to recognize Australians

745
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,069
by their speech most unfortunately our

746
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,039
variation from the accepted standard is

747
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:50,289
along lines which are harsh unmusical

748
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:53,799
and unpleasant to the ear teachers must

749
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,569
do their utmost to check this

750
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:58,559
development away from standard English

751
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,450
all nations have their symbols and

752
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,670
Australia is well served by Sydney

753
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,309
Harbour this day fit for a queen their

754
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:11,200
queen the English language had sent its

755
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
slang and its dialects to a new country

756
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,069
where they developed a personality of

757
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:17,170
their own but standard English was

758
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,329
keeping them in thrall the ways of

759
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,220
speaking in Australia formed a rigid

760
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,799
social hierarchy the broad vowels of

761
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,420
slang were at the bottom in standard

762
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,549
English Queen's English was at the top

763
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,859
the convicts might have thrown off their

764
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,140
physical shackles but the local language

765
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,210
wouldn't lose its chains until the late

766
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,670
20th century just as in the Caribbean

767
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,250
English was still keeping its children

768
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,740
down

769
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,290
but all Australia was eager for a sight

770
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,200
of this young woman yeah - it was the

771
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,610
first time that the reigning sovereign

772
00:36:47,610 --> 00:37:04,780
had landed on Australia's Shores

773
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,460
the British Empire by the turn of the

774
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,910
20th century was in its heyday and

775
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,410
British interests as every schoolchild

776
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,960
knew then had taken the english language

777
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,369
all around the globe the spread of the

778
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:23,990
language was inseparable from the

779
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,030
growing feeling of superiority which

780
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:35,660
marked the empire its people when Daniel

781
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,490
Defoe's shipwrecked Robinson Crusoe

782
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,890
encountered the man he called Friday the

783
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,510
first English word he taught his new

784
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,599
acquaintance was master there was no

785
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,640
question about who was in charge and no

786
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,500
question about the language they'd use

787
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,260
as the empire spread cruisers attitude

788
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:59,750
became the norm around the world

789
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,670
English pushed hundreds of local

790
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,640
languages aside in some cases it could

791
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,160
be said to have killed them off less

792
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,839
than half the Aboriginal languages

793
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,089
survived and they now face extinction

794
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,730
North American languages also suffered

795
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,069
among them Lakota the language of

796
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:22,520
Sitting Bull and the Sioux people did

797
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,260
you speak Lakota to your grandfather

798
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,710
yeah otherwise you wouldn't understand

799
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:34,550
me if I start speaking English we have

800
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,800
to learn the English and if we speak

801
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,319
Indian to each other then both of us

802
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,210
have to go up to that there's teachers

803
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,640
deaf and she makes us stand in front she

804
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,359
gets his big ruler about this long and

805
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,849
this thick and she slaps on him it says

806
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,310
it's already and they won't let us speak

807
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,319
our language because I think the return

808
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:02,720
that changed us into whiteness you know

809
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,109
cooking Juli sitting bullying someone

810
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,810
did hurt each other so like ortho out

811
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,819
there how much of it

812
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:13,160
I spoke to Dolores blacksmith in Chicago

813
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,260
but you don't have to go that far around

814
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,210
the world to find examples of English

815
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,960
bullying no further than Wales

816
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,490
the military political and social

817
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,349
dominance of the English over the Welsh

818
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:27,210
has always been reflected in their

819
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,280
languages when the two countries were

820
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,190
united in 1536 there was no law actually

821
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,740
to prohibit the speaking of Welsh but no

822
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,539
one who insisted on using Welsh was

823
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:38,299
allowed to hold an official position a

824
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:40,890
prejudice against the Welsh had been

825
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,640
established it continued by 1847 a Royal

826
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,230
Commission declared that the Welsh

827
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,660
language is a vast drawback to Wales and

828
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,520
a manifold barrier to the moral progress

829
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
and commercial prosperity of the people

830
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,380
and the Education Act of 1870 dictated

831
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,640
that children would have to learn

832
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,309
English in school rooms like this it

833
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:01,289
could lead to unfortunate even cruel

834
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,140
practices Welsh wasn't banned but some

835
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,089
teachers and schools outlawed it in the

836
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:09,210
classroom in some cases a token like

837
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,880
this the letters WN stand for Welsh

838
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,730
naught was placed around the neck of any

839
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,380
child slipping back into their first

840
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,140
language child was encouraged to inform

841
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,420
one child or Welsh on them that's where

842
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,400
the term came from and humiliation was

843
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:32,160
used as a cultural weapon a wish from

844
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,119
the valuing an order in the last year's

845
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,520
in the 19th century there was a push to

846
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,640
revive the Welsh language it was led by

847
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
the future Prime Minister of Britain

848
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,420
Lloyd George the National Eisteddfod

849
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,950
continued to promote and celebrate Welsh

850
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,230
language and culture bilingual signage

851
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,119
and official literature were introduced

852
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,950
in the 60s so that today the Welsh

853
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,210
language can be seen everywhere

854
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,339
throughout Wales but it's debatable

855
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,770
whether all this has really been enough

856
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,000
to turn the tide in 1900 half the people

857
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,119
in Wales spoke well by 1981 it was less

858
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,780
than one in five

859
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,640
the story seemed to be one of a long and

860
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,500
irreversible decline while English

861
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,059
marched on from strength to strength

862
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:28,369
just this year though surveys have shown

863
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:30,319
that the number of Welsh speakers is

864
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,240
increasing for the first time in two

865
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,400
centuries Welsh has found its way back

866
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,200
into the school rooms but it's still a

867
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,240
minority language 80 percent of Welsh

868
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,010
people don't speak it at all and its

869
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:45,200
future is far from certain but at least

870
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,329
the days of the Welsh note are over and

871
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,460
in Wales as elsewhere in the world

872
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,650
English is no longer acting as a

873
00:41:51,650 --> 00:42:05,750
state-approved bully as the British

874
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,119
Empire has faded away English has had to

875
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,890
come to terms with a changed world

876
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,420
reaching accommodations with local

877
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,859
languages and with new political

878
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:21,890
realities

879
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,380
here in India the new constitution which

880
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,150
followed independence plan to abolish

881
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,430
English altogether and instead make

882
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,040
Hindi the sole official language but it

883
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,850
didn't happen

884
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,280
Hindi is only the first language in some

885
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,260
states of India and other parts of their

886
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,030
own languages like here in Calcutta and

887
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,310
the rest of Bengal where Bengali is

888
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,040
spoken regional rivalries are often

889
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,870
fierce and so the users of other

890
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,210
languages exerted political pressure in

891
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,400
some places even wyott it to keep

892
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,200
English rather than be forced to use

893
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,780
Hindi and even the most cursory glance

894
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,580
at any of these bookstores here in

895
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,950
Kolkata will show you how English is

896
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,620
still part of Indian life its minority

897
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,390
language but it's the language in which

898
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,310
many Indian states communicate with each

899
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,140
other and with the outside world and

900
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,660
that gives it tremendous part some would

901
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:16,240
say too much

902
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:22,250
it's 7:30 a.m. in Calcutta the

903
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,170
Tollygunge Club is the favorite meeting

904
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,150
place for the state's top officials and

905
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,650
captains of industry for these people

906
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,590
English is a badge indicating that part

907
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,520
of India's social and ruling elite

908
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,500
across town in another world Street

909
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:49,460
children are being taught the basics for

910
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,830
them English might mean a finger hole

911
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,750
the scrap of advantage in getting a job

912
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,830
against desparate all across India

913
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,420
parents of all classes will make great

914
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,580
efforts to make English part of their

915
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:10,880
child's education

916
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,680
for this man English is the language he

917
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,480
must hire to deal with the bureaucracy

918
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,020
of taxing a car for this man it's

919
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,589
essential to his business

920
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:27,839
somebody came and hit the vehicle many

921
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,760
Indians sleep happily from English into

922
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
the native Bengali or Hindi and back

923
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,710
again for them English has become in a

924
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:53,000
sense another Indian language

925
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,470
in other parts of the former Empire

926
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,510
English and his linguistic offspring

927
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,220
have also had to come to terms with

928
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,640
independence in Australia it came later

929
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,470
the election of the Whitlam government

930
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,120
in 1972 rode a wave of nationalism

931
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,170
Australia began to look back towards

932
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,600
Britain less than it looked forward to

933
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,340
its own future as a multicultural

934
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,160
country four years later the first

935
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,350
Australian dictionary to be compiled in

936
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,000
Australia reached the bookshelves

937
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,460
helping to legitimize the language and

938
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,190
showing that Australia had cast off its

939
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,560
cultural cringe and was ready to revel

940
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,620
in its own distinctive language this is

941
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,260
the Macario dictionary in the in the DS

942
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,870
alone you find Australian words like

943
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,380
dagi meaning dirty or slovenly from DAGs

944
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,450
the name given to the matted Tufts of

945
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,030
wool around a sheep's bottom dead has

946

947
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,220
sleep it off delle a shortened form of

person drag an adjective depressingly

952
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,010
unattractive possibly from Dracula and

953
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,280
Donnie an outside toilet a name that can

954
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,660
be traced back to the English words

955
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,600
Donna meaning dong and Ken meaning place

956
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,520
or house in old British dialects you

957
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,010
could find Daniken or Dunnigan the

958
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,080
Australian shortened it and keep it in

959
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,970
use

960
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,000
vocabulary aside Australian English has

961
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
developed some distinct variations in

962
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,170
return good no I'm done by secular

963
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,980
campus and bricky

964
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,530
I think there are two features that

965
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,020
really earmark Australian English at

966
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,770
least for me

967
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,099
one is the abbreviations that Straley in

968
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,740
love of shortenings so that a word if

969
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,630
it's not a ready a single syllable gets

970
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,790
reduced to a single syllable and then an

971
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,240
ending is I'm going on e ending or an O

972
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,960
ending so something like my mate Jacko

973
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,690
the weirdo Jono from Frio he slept on a

974
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,240
bit of lino during your smoker one arvo

975
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,990
and ended up on compo and a real vero

976
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,040
another characteristic I think of

977
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,990
Australian English is the sometimes

978
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,720
called HRT this is not hormone

979
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,250
replacement therapy but high-rise

980
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:11,970
terminal

981
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:13,470
it's the Australian questioning

982
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,180
intonation so it really is like the

983
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,099
rising intonation of a yes/no question

984
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:25,990
except that you find it on statements

985
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,580
like one of the servo and here in

986
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,800
Australia you encounter quite well

987
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,960
amused probably even hostile reactions

988
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,900
now to British receive pronunciation and

989
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,820
Queen's English people find them

990
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,500
affected now and they're wanting much

991
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:54,290
more to speak Australian English

992
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,430
independence reached the West Indies in

993
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,320
the 1960s and with it came a

994
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,450
determination to reject the colonial

995
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,609
past in ordered sports here in Jamaica

996
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:04,950
there's been a campaign to make patois

997
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,380
the local speech a socially acceptable

998
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,510
as standard English it's all around and

999
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,970
no longer regarded as a badge of social

1000
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:32,060
inferiority

1001
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,530
anybody who wants to communicate for the

1002
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,349
public feel effectively in a language of

1003
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,630
of feeling and a language that will get

1004
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:48,470
them to move and uses abundance of

1005
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,609
Muhammad obviously wanted to popular

1006
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:53,849
music it's a region region top shoes are

1007
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,670
largely carried out in Jamaican even by

1008
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,589
people who can speak English it was not

1009
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:03,060
the language of hostility for illiterate

1010
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,780
ignorant people

1011
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,090
patois on the airwaves or in the

1012
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,610
dancehall is one thing for it to be

1013
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,110
tolerated or encouraged in the

1014
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,210
schoolroom is another not if you work

1015
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,070
with the top chapter anything governor

1016
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:23,740
of env people - how are you is when

1017
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,840
Jamaica was under slavery because Caesar

1018
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,990
was abolished the breaks there are those

1019
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,420
like the purge and performer Joan Andrew

1020
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,820
Hutchinson who actively promote patois

1021
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,070
among children but it's not government

1022
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,800
policy yet to teach it in schools here a

1023
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:49,120
standard English is still the norm and

1024
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,710
there are those who argue the children

1025
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,630
educated in partner at the expense of

1026
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,610
English will be placed at a serious

1027
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,590
disadvantage in dealing with the rest of

1028
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,400
the english-speaking world and see

1029
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,070
typical anglo-saxon response the

1030
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,420
anglo-saxons seem to think that people

1031
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,250
can only speak one language right in

1032
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,350
fact Molly's multilingualism bilingual

1033
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,090
reserve is the norm there's no

1034
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,340
particular reason why Jamaica will be

1035
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,680
cut off simply because Jamaicans used to

1036
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,210
make up all right the language is

1037
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,400
popularly called password for purposes

1038
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,730
of organizing their lives internally and

1039
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,350
using English for international

1040
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,690
communication but I think it's a mindset

1041
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,550
an anglo-saxon I'm certain which our

1042
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:30,220
English is the official language of

1043
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,050
written in the US and is also an

1044
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,910
international language absolutely our

1045
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,110
history

1046
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,810
historically English began its Imperial

1047
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,830
adventure as an export from our Islands

1048
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,050
it's for new English's new varieties

1049
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,600
that were at first despised by speakers

1050
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,670
from the mother country which grew into

1051
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,590
distinct from national tongues as their

1052
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,480
speakers freed themselves from their

1053
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,450
colonial past today English and his

1054
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,730
offspring stand side-by-side around the

1055
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,040
world a world in which English as we'll

1056
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,770
see has adopted a crucial role as a

1057
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:51,369
global language

1058
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:56,460
you

1059
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,520
you
