1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,010
saluton kai bon venon ala lhasa program

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,420
all on shi xuxia do and for those of you

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,880
don't speak Esperanto I just said hello

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,250
and welcome to the last program in the

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,470
adventure of English it's often argued

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,750
that the modern world needs a common

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,550
language with which to communicate

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,070
that's why Esperanto was invented in the

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,870
late 19th century with a dream of

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,270
providing an artificial second language

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,180
for all the people of the world there'd

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
been numerous attempts and similar

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,050
schemes but none of them anywhere near

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,539
as popular as a language which spread by

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
natural selection through the 20th

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,760
century English English can now claim to

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,039
be a global language more so than any

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:27,880
other language in history

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,580
I'm in Chicago the Windy City the 20th

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,490
century could be said to begin here in

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,950
1871 a fire had destroyed old Chicago

22
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,890
but within two years an entire new city

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,740
was built for a new century with a huge

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,630
charge of economic and technical

25
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,910
development America was about to burst

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,460
onto the global stage the German

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,130
Chancellor Otto von Bismarck said near

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,740
the end of the 19th century the decisive

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,229
element of modern history is the fact

30
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,590
that the North Americans speak English

31
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,120
but there were now two English Azur one

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,830
language that we might call English -

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,229
American or American - English and the

34
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,000
story of the last century is how these

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
two English's have grown together

36
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,360
sometimes in harmony

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,340
sometimes in competition

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,290
America was flexing its economic muscles

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,390
at that time and the words and phrases

40
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,890
reflect that big business executive

41
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,960
well-heeled fat cat go-getter and

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,210
yes-man as well as assembly line and

43
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,670
close shop they're all American English

44
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,500
Europe and its towers but it took

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,480
America to build and to name that

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,880
quintessential image of the country the

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:52,470
skyscraper

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,590
the first skyscraper ever was built here

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,770
in Chicago in 1885 it's been knocked

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,780
down but this one was built soon

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,790
afterwards it's now the oldest one still

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,920
standing in Chicago now it's a hotel

53
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,990
hotel in the modern sense is an American

54
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,180
word in French she just meant a large

55
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,550
private house and it was in America that

56
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,740
they first called this reception area a

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,170
lobby with this desk clock I mean Clerk

58
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,790
dressed in black of course at the front

59
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,100
desk is bellhop and it's concierge

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,230
another European word given its modern

61
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,510
meaning in America to get to your

62
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,880
penthouse if you should be so lucky you

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,340
would of course need an elevator English

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,110
already had the rather less technical

65
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,570
word lifts but as Oscar Wilde inevitably

66
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,700
said we have really everything in common

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,550
with America nowadays except of course

68
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:49,050
language you can see it everywhere I'm

69
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,400
gonna tell gives us quite a few examples

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,070
in England we would have a wardrobe this

71
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,200
is a closet in England we have a

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,670
bathroom well that's the same but could

73
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,380
also be called a washroom the tub with a

74
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,130
faucet not a bath with the tap and when

75
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,750
we go into the bedroom at least that's

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,780
the same word we find that the window

77
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,630
has drapes not curtains the bed has

78
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,790
covers not bedclothes instead of a

79
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,070
dressing gown here's a bathrobe beside

80
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,840
the bed there's a nightstand not a

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,970
bedside table and somewhere there's a

82
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,730
trashcan not a wastepaper basket the

83
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,440
British had long looked down on the way

84
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,540
the Americans used the language color

85
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,490
age thought the word talented was a vile

86
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,740
and barbarous American word but he was

87
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,410
in fact English Dickens noted how they

88
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,150
corrupted the language with words like

89
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,510
reliable and lengthy there's always been

90
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,880
some perhaps misinformed resistance to

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
American words but the Americans had

92
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,960
never cared much for English opinion

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,310
about their use of the English language

94
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,100
the bird what Whitman observed in 1888

95
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,410
that American English was the apotheosis

96
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,310
of slang a glorious new language he said

97
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,750
reinvented away from the traditions and

98
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,950
authority of British English

99
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,310
two days ago let's go for the one-on-one

100
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,470
and with omelet you also get a corn

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,450
muffin a biscuit or toast you guys get

102
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,960
growth you get Apple maple or chicken in

103
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,520
doing the psychiatry's looked at we

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,290
should point out that the increase will

105
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,640
not be any more than this day means

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,100
right where they're writing over 2600

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,700
and a quarter

108
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,400
all righty in Britain correct English

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,350
was linked with manners morals and of

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,990
course class just as one had to keep a

111
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,940
straight bat and hold ones knife and

112
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,530
fork correctly so one had to use the

113
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,450
right word use the wrong one and you

114
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,180
could be caught out and ward in English

115
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,250
abhorred flamboyance when somebody wrote

116
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,840
a group had broke the young poet who

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,700
died during the first world war that he

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,280
left Cambridge University in a blaze of

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,130
glory the poet's mother crossed out that

120
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,110
melodramatic phrase and replaced it with

121
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,660
a single word he read he left Cambridge

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,500
University in July in part here was a

123
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,570
case of British formality versus

124
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,240
American informality American was

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,860
thought to be a classless version of

126
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,390
English and there were those in at

127
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,470
Warner Society

128
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,510
who found that idea difficult to

129
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,880
tolerate but the First World War would

130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,680
test and change most of them

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,449
Edwardian English like its Victorian

132
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,870
parent love pageantry pomp and a society

133
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,960
where every word knew its place the

134
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,460
trenches of the First World War

135
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,130
detonated much of that the First World

136
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,440
War gave us new figures of speech as

137
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,169
well as a vision of equality here in the

138
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,900
trenches before the war if you were in

139
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,380
trouble

140
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,270
or under pressure you might have said

141
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,070
you'd been thrown like a horse rider

142
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,350
into a wasteland or a swamp perhaps

143
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,050
under a shower of criticism words drawn

144
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,780
from peaceful country life after 1918

145
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,979
you'd probably say you're being

146
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,280
bombarded under a barrage shell-shocked

147
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
or in no-man's land the First World War

148
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,470
gave British English firepower and

149
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,410
frontline gas masks and camouflage bunk

150
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,289
for tishell with artillery and done for

151
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:07,199
defective round the balloon goes up was

152
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,820
the signal for the artillery to open

153
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,900
fire at zero are over the top comes from

154
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,580
the terrifying moment of climbing out of

155
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,949
the trench the biblical phrase at the

156
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:19,530
11th hour gained a new meaning from the

157
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,659
time the final ceasefire was declared on

158
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,090
Armistice Day all terms from the very

159
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,470
end of world war war when the armistice

160
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,630
finally came more than the first world

161
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,880
war was over it underlined what was

162
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,220
already a trend the shift of power in

163
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,370
many areas including language to America

164
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,169
while Europe had been burning the USA

165
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,940
had experienced massive industrial

166
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,500
expansion

167
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,330
the factories of the northern states

168
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,460
needed new workers and the poor of the

169
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,620
South many of the descendants of former

170
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,660
slaves saw the opportunity they offered

171
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,350
and moved in

172
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,330
the migrants overwhelmingly black came

173
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,250
along tracks like these and railroads

174
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,870
like these they came to the cities of

175
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,910
the north cities like Chicago pounding

176
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,650
with growth then and pounding with

177
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,170
growth now and they changed America they

178
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,780
also changed the English language in the

179
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,460
nineteenth century almost all Afro

180
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,020
Americans had lived in the south by the

181
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,850
end of the century ninety five percent

182
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,400
were up in the north and they injected

183
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,410
the new energies of the language they

184
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,870
brought African speech African rhythm

185
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:43,760
new vocabulary together and put black

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,560
speech into mainstream American was

187
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
music first jazz then blues new words

188
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,420
and expressions started to accompany the

189
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,040
soundtrack of what America's perhaps

190
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,950
best known for popular culture today the

191
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,540
language would be unimaginable without

192
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,280
its colonization by words and

193
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,290
expressions of black and African origin

194
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,990
the very words jazz and blues arrived

195
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,430
from a pro-american speech at the

196
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,110
beginning of the century the African

197
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,160
word hypocrite

198
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080
meaning attuned to the environment or

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,940
with his eyes open gave us hepcat and

200
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,670
later hip and cat later still of course

201
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,320
its meaning grew to include the idea of

202
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,110
hippie white American embraced black

203
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,790
American speech when people started to

204
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,590
dance the hootchy-kootchy and then the

205
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,350
cakewalk the shimmy jive and boogie

206
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:33,400
woogie

207
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,630
and perhaps it was the sex in black

208
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,640
music that seduced white America jazz

209
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,440
itself may originally have been a word

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,330
meaning to have sex later on rock and

211
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,730
roll certainly was Jelly Roll cherry pie

212
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,350
and custard pie were all words of the

213
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,360
female organ Shack up in the sense of

214
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,190
living together comes from black speech

215
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,900
at this time to Black American

216
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,150
expressions are now so mainstream that

217
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,980
it's forgotten almost all Americans and

218
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,690
very many British including almost all

219
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,880
youths now speak some sort of black

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,980
young people want to be cool or bad

221
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,750
which was first recorded as meaning good

222
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,480
in America in 1928 and this might want

223
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
to be groovy or mellow which came from

224
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,530
melody in jazz circles in the early 40s

225
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:22,620
Square is out but it may come back

226
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,880
thank you but it wasn't just black words

227
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,410
flooding into American English in the

228
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,990
early 20th century around that time the

229
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,760
country's population nearly doubled in

230
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
just 30 years mainly due to incomers

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,170
from Central and Eastern Europe as more

232
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,940
Europeans migrated here and began to

233
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,500
speak English words from their own

234
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,810
languages came with an American English

235
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,570
like English English before it was ready

236
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,670
enabled to soak them all up and what the

237
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,860
France forum now sounds apple-pie

238
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,180
American English

239
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,630
if this coffee had been really hot

240
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,970
someone it might have said ouch from the

241
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,209
German word ouch aut s CH as well as

242
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,430
hamburger and frankfurter the Germans

243
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,410
gave us words like wonder list seminar

244
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,630
dumb for stupid and even the game of

245
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,180
poker from the German fortune bond

246
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,160
meaning trap comes from bumbler a

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,810
good-for-nothing hold on

248
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,330
from Pelton and so long from the German

249
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,779
Zoo langa langa itself may originally

250
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,540
come from the it is Shalom bagels locked

251
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,850
pastrami and borscht became part about

252
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,540
not another Yiddish word soon German and

253
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,400
Yiddish speech patterns flooded the

254
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,080
language and by the end of the century

255
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,180
we would all quite naturally be using

256
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,120
turns of phrase such as am i hungry I'm

257
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,970
telling you now he tells me could I use

258
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,480
a drink

259
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,660
I should worry and there was plenty to

260
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,089
worry about in the 1920s the prohibition

261
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,400
of alcohol encouraged gangsters and in a

262
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,830
garage on this unremarkable site seven

263
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,050
men were moaned down by Al Capone's mob

264
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,060
in the notorious cent Valentine's Day

265
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,300
Massacre it was a time of racketeers and

266
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,089
hatchet men of goons and Fink's if you

267
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,310
took the rap for a heist you might find

268
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,410
yourself in the can or even in the hot

269
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,540
seat especially for a hijack with the

270
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,470
submachine gun

271
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,800
a woman was a chick a bimbo a broad or a

272
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,410
babe and the telephone was a blower we

273
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,750
learned not to spill the beans or we'd

274
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,910
be taken for a ride and to avoid

275
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,579
gimmicks and pranksters junkies pushers

276
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,860
and the fuzz and when we drank hooch

277
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,519
we had to watch out for

278
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,630
gangsters are forever linked with the

279
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,910
movies never more so than here John

280
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,769
Dillinger the FBI's public enemy number

281
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,990
one was gunned down as he left the

282
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,839
Biograph movie theater in 1934 he was

283
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,089
fingered or betrayed by his companion

284
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,480
the notorious lady in red she's still

285
00:12:49,480 --> 00:13:09,490
here by the 1930s motion pictures and

286
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,769
sound had been united and the talkies

287
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,810
were in full swing bringing a new

288
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,300
vocabulary going to the movies at a

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,370
movie theater on Nickelodeon was a

290
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,320
national pastime you could see the stars

291
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,050
in closer in a weeping or a tearjerker

292
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,510
laughs at some slapstick I'll be gripped

293
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,550
by a spine chiller or a cliffhanger

294
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,889
while the usherette was selling Isis you

295
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,570
could watch a trailer for next week's

296
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,850
show you might even dream of going for a

297
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,160
screen test to yourself more than

298
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,620
anything else the talking picture would

299
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,079
be the engine-- to spread American ideas

300
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,240
and american english from hollywood

301
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,160
around the country and then around the

302
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:52,860
globe over the next century

303
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,449
but back in britain their language

304
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,930
caused an outrage

305
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,490
the words and accents were perfectly

306
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,680
disgusting and there can be no doubt

307
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,019
that such films are an evil influence on

308
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,160
our society those truly loathsome

309
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,769
transatlantic importation z' to help

310
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,390
meit worthwhile nearby and colorful are

311
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,839
spreading like the plague but with the

312
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,910
popularity of Hollywood those complaints

313
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,250
were simply swept aside by most people

314
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,440
in Britain films were starting to bring

315
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
the two languages closer together

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,250
but despite the incursions of its

317
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,800
vigorous cousin English in the UK was

318
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
alive and well with its own style and

319
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,910
also with an awareness of American

320
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,760
influence PG Woodhouse defined himself

321
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,740
in some measure by stressing Englishness

322
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,110
yet he was informal and up-to-date with

323
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,580
phrase making as you

324
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,150
see for a couple surprises she had a

325
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,100
penetrating sort of laughs rather like a

326
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,990
train going into a tunnel you could say

327
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,850
first avid warden English second North

328
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,250
American English or the such a thing is

329
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,280
going too far and you have gone it again

330
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,190
could be it warden and America would

331
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,020
house came to school here a Dulwich

332
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,820
College in London and he left the school

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,520
his books and the desk on which he wrote

334
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,100
many of them and a writer regarded as

335
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,410
the epitome of American style also came

336
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,880
here to Dodge College

337
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,800
Raymond Chandler was seven years younger

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,630
than Woodhouse he was born in Chicago

339
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,940
but came to England as a young boy and

340
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,830
became naturalized British at the age of

341
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,740

in a timeless America Marla is the name

346
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,790
of a house of this school just as

347
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,350
Woodhouse played with British English

348
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,330
chandra played with american english

349
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,180
making it elegant but tough it was a

350
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,150
blonde a blonde to make a bishop pick a

351
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,540
hole in a stained-glass window she gave

352
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,720
me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket

353
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,790
in the air Chandler published the

354
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,860
entertaining American prose of farewell

355
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,050
my lovely Hitler was preparing to invade

356
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,360
England and make German the common

357
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,760
language of Europe different situations

358
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,900
make different demands on a language we

359
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,570
shall go on to the end which will fight

360
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,330
on the Seas and oceans we should fight

361
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,970
in the air which will fight on the

362
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,220
beaches we shall fight on the landing

363
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,730
grounds we shall fight in the fields and

364
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,890
in the streets we shall fight in the

365
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,450
Hills we shall never surrender this is

366
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,730
part of Churchill's War Rooms on the

367
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,650
ground behind Downing Street and from

368
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,310
this desk

369
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,520
he made his broadcasts to the nation in

370
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,310
1940 Britain stood alone against Hitler

371
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,710
Winston Churchill made a speech which

372
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,380
drew on the deep historical roots of the

373
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,810
English language it's a masterpiece of

374
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,970
rhythm and rhetoric Churchill had

375
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,470
studied the speeches of Elizabeth the

376
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,200
first and this has the same resolve as

377
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,480
her words at Tilbury which inspired the

378
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,150
English to repulse the Spanish Armada

379
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,220
and it digs deeper into the history of

380
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,620
English all but a handful of words here

381
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,720
can be traced back to Old English the

382
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,059
key vocabulary we shall go on to the end

383
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,800
fight strength Island landing ground

384
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,360
field Street hills and never had all

385
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,250
been part of English for more than a

386
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,390
thousand years

387
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,699
Churchill was rallying some of the

388
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,459
country's oldest words to the fight not

389
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,550
to the battle that was a French word and

390
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,480
surrender to is a French word the

391
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,000
hostile Nazi invasion never came but in

392
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,130
1942 a friendly American one did nothing

393
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,630
could reverse the effects of such

394
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,760
sustained exposure to American English

395
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,280
the GIS introduced words like beef

396
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,220
burger crew-cut and disc jockey gizmo

397
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:59,559
gobbledygook pinup and GI bride but the

398
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,360
traffic was not all one way the

399
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,890
Americans published this book a short

400
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,780
guide to Great Britain the war and Navy

401
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,700
Department Washington DC for all the

402
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,160
troops in this country it's very

403
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,780
friendly and I think a cute about the

404
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,460
British the British were reserved it

405
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,809
says but not unfriendly then it

406
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,000
describes it don't show off it says the

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,370
British dislike showing off don't say

408
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,750
you've got too much money you've got

409
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,070
much more than the British and don't

410
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,350
show off about it they learn how to eat

411
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,179
they learned that french fries with

412
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:27,790
chips and a smoked herring was a kipper

413
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,800
they learnt at bowling alleys and

414
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,520
tenpins

415
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,290
we're skipper Holly's with nine things

416
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,450
but a five and ten store should be

417
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,700
called a bazaar and then instead of okay

418
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
they should say right oh and they were

419
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,700
told the British are tough don't be

420
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,860
misled by the British tendency to be

421
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,350
soft-spoken and polite the English

422
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,000
language didn't spread across oceans

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,429
mountains jungles and swamps of the

424
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,140
world because these people were

425
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,620
pantywaists pantywaist that's American

426
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,450
English thought the British would have

427
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,320
called a by 1944 on the eve of

428
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,809
d-day one and a half million United

429
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,490
States soldiers were billeted around

430
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,110
grim

431
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,779
the Americans eventually returned home

432
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,880
but the language they brought with them

433
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,940
stayed ever since and English was

434
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:27,529
massively enriched

435
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:30,510
in March 2000 the Pope made his historic

436
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,210
first ever visit to Israel on this

437
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,830
important occasion he addressed his

438
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,539
hosts not in their own language Hebrew

439
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,850
nor in the Vatican's official language

440
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,549
Latin nor in his native polish but in

441
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:47,429
English may peace be last given through

442
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:52,799
the lab he chose English has become the

443
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,929
primary language of global communication

444
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,820
the most understood language in the

445
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,850
world so why has English becomes so

446
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,460
important on the world stage 19th

447
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,960
century linguists felt that there was

448
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,419
something special and unique about the

449
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:11,220
language itself in 1851 Jakob Grimm of

450
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,380
the Brothers Grimm told the Royal

451
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,360
Academy of Berlin that English was the

452
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,190
strongest language because it had

453
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,049
dropped all its complicated word endings

454
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,779
he wrote of all modern languages not one

455
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:23,970
has acquired such a great strength and

456
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,429
vigor as the English for none of the

457
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,230
living languages can be compared with it

458
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,649
as to richness rationality and close

459
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:34,260
construction you'd be hard-pressed to

460
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,909
find any linguist today who'd follow

461
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,340
that line or even a less triumphalist

462
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,020
argument put forward by another foreign

463
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,470
scholar the Dane Otto Jespersen in 1905

464
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,289
he wrote the French language is like the

465
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,870
stiff French garden lure the four teams

466
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,270
while the English language is like an

467
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,250
English Park in which are allowed to

468
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,320
walk everywhere without having to fear

469
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,350
rigorous regulations but most linguist

470
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,720
today would agree not with the genius of

471
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,820
Jakob Grimm but with the linguistic

472
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,070
scholar David crystal but the spread of

473
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,690
a language is little to do with its

474
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,690
intrinsic qualities social political and

475
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,820
economic factors are now seen as the

476
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,679
forces behind the spread of languages

477
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,929
there's a saying among linguists that a

478
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,700
language is a dialect with an army in

479
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,850
the Navy so a language that spreads just

480
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,590
has more quite

481
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,520
at the end of the Second World War

482
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,020
British and American troops were

483
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,850
stationed as administrators in Europe

484
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,220
and the Far East in Japan learning

485
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,500
English became compulsory in Germany

486
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,570
knowing English gave people an edge in

487
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,190
dealing with officials and regulations

488
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,410
after the Reich and a world impoverished

489
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,870
by the war turned his eyes anxiously to

490
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,320
the American dream expressing not only

491
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,070
the American love of beauty but also the

492
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,110
basic freedom of the American people and

493
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,940
the language of that dream was English a

494
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,770
language that came to represent the

495
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,540
delights of consumption and consumerism

496
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,820
of material advance and its promise of

497
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,220
happiness but perhaps the most desirable

498
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,260

it made the English language adapt and

502
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,140
expand to a whole new vocabulary in 1948

503
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,150
this was the state of the art of what

504
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,340
the boffins were calling the electronic

505

the micro circuit the database the chip

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
and the mass the floppy disk and the

515
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,470

significant trading language global

528
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,970
trade in English is reckoned to be worth

529
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,640
over 4000 billion dollars that's three

530
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,020
or four times as much of the next

531
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,060
richest languages Japanese and German

532
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,700
though Chinese is more native speakers

533

than English trade conducted in Chinese

534
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,110
is just one tenth of the value of trade

535
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,070

539
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,559
there's an international rule the seller

540
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,390
speaks the buyers language if I want

541
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,960
your money

542
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,520
it pays me to learn to talk to you in

543
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,590
your language it's the same on a larger

544
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,150
scale whether selling postcards to

545
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,919

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,710
English fluently as if it were a first

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,780
language mostly two second or third

550
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,210
language but it's reckoned that a third

551
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,280
of the population here have some sort of

552
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,110
familiarity with the language and that's

553
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,440
over 300 million people and that pattern

554
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
is repeated around the globe wherever

555
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,910
there's a population of English speakers

556
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,500
you'll find a much larger number of

557
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,690
people who come into contact with it and

558
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,580
have some knowledgeable or at least

559
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,020
learning it now is their time to relax

560
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,580
and enjoy the program in the second half

561
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,410
of the 20th century the number of people

562
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,880
speaking English as their first language

563
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,450
has doubled to nearly 400 million

564
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,250
though it's still not as many as the 900

565
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,120

today however there are another 500

568
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,200
million people around the world who are

569
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,360
bilingual in English or at least speak

570
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,400
it fluently it's here that the big

571
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,590
expansion has taken place the number has

572
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,530
quadrupled in 50 years but because of

573
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,630
its usefulness as a second language some

574
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,220
thousand million other people are

add it together

577
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,620
that's about 2000 million people or a

578
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,480
third of the world's population who have

579
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,230
some knowledge of English it's an

580
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,810
unprecedented expansion English is now

581
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,580

something had to be done and in 1994 the

665
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,909
Academie Francaise dictionary did admit

666
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,219
about 6,000 new words to the French

667
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,289
language including for the first time a

668
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,879
number of from glare words and

669
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,799
expressions well most of them from the

670
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,589
1950s such as the covergirl the best

671
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:24,109
seller and the blue jeans most of those

672
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:26,419
in everyday use from the weekend d'leh

673
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,629
zoom were excluded it's not just the old

674
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:32,330
english french rivalry Norway and Brazil

675
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,129
have recently adopted similar measures

676
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:38,599
to keep English out it's a colorful

677
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,099
words that people want to borrow from

678
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,349
English but the language uses a tool for

679
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,119
international documents is a different

680
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,450
matter this is a sample it's an English

681
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,399
that bears only a passing resemblance to

682
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:51,440
the language you and I speak according

683
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,259
to Article 7 of directive 96 struck 92

684
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,869
struck EC member states must designate a

685
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,820
system operator to be responsible for

686
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,830
operating ensuring the maintenance of an

687
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,639
if necessary

688
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,409
developing the transmission system in a

689
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:05,389
given area and it's interconnection with

690
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,789
other systems etc mind you there are

691
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,679
places in England where they write like

692
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,019
this we've all been globalized it's very

693
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,989
important and it's very dull it's this

694
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,489
official sort of language that's being

695
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:18,229
promoted around the world by government

696
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,210
bodies multinational corporations and

697
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,190
the international associations it's

698
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,259
stripped out terms of speech and

699
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,629
colorful idioms deliberately so because

700
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,580
this is language designed to be easily

701
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,529
understood internationally and local

702
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,809
terms could be confusing this sort of

703
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,789
globalization I think could become a

704
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,039
cemetry for English is anyone ever going

705
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,539
to write a poem in this sort of language

706
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,089
or use it when they fall in love or when

707
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,350
they have a real row

708
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,630
or express any of the personal feelings

709
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,120
they have but thankfully as English

710
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,679
spreads around the globe alongside its

711
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,360
official use it has developed rich

712
00:30:50,360 --> 00:31:00,140
vernacular varieties English has been

713
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,299
spoken in Singapore since the early 19th

714
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,100
century but after independence from

715
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,260
Britain in 1958 Singapore went a step

716
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,150
further and English was made the

717
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,380
official language of business and

718
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,080
government besides its ability to unite

719
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,059
an ethnically diverse population of

720
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:16,490
Chinese Malays and Indians the economic

721
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,250
potential of English was paramount at

722
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,289
school children learn their own first

723
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,750
language but they must all learn English

724
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,929
an elite minority language has become

725
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:37,750
the property of the whole population but

726
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,190
the day-to-day English that the people

727
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,380
of Singapore actually speak is a far cry

728
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,789
from the official English of the

729
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,740
government wants them to learn it's a

730
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,990
vibrant expressive dialect nicknamed

731
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,750
Singlish full of vocabulary grammar and

732
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,039
inflections borrowed from the

733
00:31:52,039 --> 00:32:16,669
Singaporeans languages regional so all

734
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:31,809
the know not my liner I know I know this

735
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:37,070
is it now my zone and this may be the

736
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,929
irony of the global spread of English

737
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:41,539
the more widely spoken the more it may

738
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:43,429
fracture into local dialects which

739
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,470
become increasingly mutually

740
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,230
unintelligible

741
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,850
people will make English their own and

742
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,590
in doing so will make it something else

743
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,020
there's a certain before to Latin which

744
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,280
broke into French Italian Spanish

745
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,070
Portuguese in Romania but English has

746
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,530
always embraced variety in change and it

747
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,900
still does and in the final part of our

748
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,000
final program I'd be looking at how

749
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:21,510
English is behaving now in this country

750
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,760
in this series have looked at how

751
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,950
English began as an obscure tribal

752
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,679
dialect 1,500 years ago and became a

753
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,929
language for the world spoken more

754
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:33,419
widely and with more variety than any

755
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,179
other language in history for this the

756
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,880
final part of the final program I want

757
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,860
to go down these islands to take

758
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,799
soundings of the state of English in its

759
00:33:43,799 --> 00:34:06,110
homeland today

760
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,120
when English came here in the fifth

761
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,919
century it began to push the Celtic

762
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,929
languages to the fringes to the margins

763
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,350
to Wales of course to Cornwall and here

764
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,970
to the Outer Hebrides and in all those

765
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,060
places it's hung on I'm on Ness at the

766
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,190
northern tip of the Outer Hebrides and

767
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,450
the language around here spoken by

768
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,330
almost everyone is Scots Gaelic it's one

769
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,970
of UNESCO s endangered languages but so

770
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,970
far it's hung on almost miraculously but

771
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,960
now after 1,500 years it's facing its

772
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,800
biggest battle ever against the still

773
00:34:39,800 --> 00:35:03,570
relentless advance of English did you

774
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,430
have English and Gaelic when you went to

775
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,130
school in Bathurst I'm a staff member

776
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,170
but I don't think I had a one word of

777
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,560
English

778
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,570
this traditional Hobart en villages

779
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,700
abandoned 30 years ago a local

780
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,830
population in our bilingual but these

781
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,810
adults grew up speaking only Gallic and

782
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,080
had to learn English at school I think

783
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,720
we could they could catch and I would

784
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,560
think and part of the alphabet but it

785
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,930
wasn't a totally strange language to me

786
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,440
as I remember well we have a seat yeah I

787
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,930
think I was totally bilingual by the

788
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,060
time I left secondary school my

789
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,980
grandfather's generation would speak

790
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,950
English in a way different from what we

791
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,080
would we were very conscious that they

792
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,990
were a literal translation that they

793
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,730
were as we would put it at that time

794
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:03,960
that they were less advanced there's

795
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,830
still some of that today and in the time

796
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,510
that it's after being here I was after

797
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,850
talking to somebody or after being

798
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,510
somewhere but unless the yourself or

799
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,800
myself

800
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,350
did you stuff your snap yes when do

801
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,590
people with me say it's yourself yes

802
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,000
although youngsters nowadays they've got

803
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,369
whatever transfers across from the media

804
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,560
but if you're talking about something

805
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,050
like pop music or something in the media

806
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,190
that you've seen you're not going to

807
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,450
talk about it in Gaelic when it's been

808
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,950
in English that you've actually seen it

809
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,630
but division forwards and garlic which

810
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,000
describe situations so much better

811
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
for example key analyst is whom well

812
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,330
it's more than homesickness

813
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,950
but you see Skype homesickness but it

814
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,560
takes in sort of nostalgia and a lot of

815
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,420
feeling more more so than homesickness

816
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,960
and the same applies to old man we would

817
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,720
use the word bother the old Bo doctor in

818
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,210
the road until the old bottle next door

819
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,720
I would speak Alec to my grandmother and

820
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,180
my mother but to my friends I speak

821
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,760
English galaxies to have an image

822
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,910
problem amongst the young people I mean

823
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,380
we used to speak garlic all the time we

824
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,970
were in primary school but if you have

825
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,230
one person who comes into your classes

826
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,270
speaks English everybody has to change

827
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,970
order that person's isolated so ever

828
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,830
since then I mean we've been speaking

829
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,119
English to everybody was just so used to

830
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,300
it no to have it the English spoken here

831
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,910
still has a tang of the Gallic but his

832
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,280
age is getting duller it's sounding more

833
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,230
and more gradually like the language of

834
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,450
the mainland but how stable is that

835
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,510
English continues to demel a way up here

836
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,290
and if even louis weakens can glasgow be

837
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:56,230
far behind

838
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,610
Glasgow has some of the most distinctive

839
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,130
voices in Britain companies like a call

840
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,080
centres here because they think that the

841
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,060
softer version of the glass region

842
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,860
accent is one of the most trustworthy

843
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,740
and friendly in the country I'll send an

844
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:34,970
email to Azure and request but at its

845
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,010
broadest glass region dialect is

846
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,140
farthest away from standard English it

847
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,180
can be virtually incomprehensible to

848
00:38:41,180 --> 00:39:08,300
outside many Daleks have eroded to the

849
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,430
extent that they're just accents but

850
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,380
other dialects have retained their

851
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,930
distinctive nature glass region is a

852
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,900
dialect which is made up of a rain

853
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,430
actually two different forms of English

854
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,200
Scottish English which was taken over in

855
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,880
the 18th century which is essentially

856
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,470
standard English spoken with a Scottish

857
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,280
accent and then Scots which has its own

858
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,650
distinctive historical development for

859
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,470
example Old English air is head

860
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,240
infantile English that has been retained

861
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,550
but in Scotland is II so it's he'd

862
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,050
glasgow university sends researchers

863
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,790
into the streets to monitor changes in

864
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,300
speech right so one at a time this

865
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,930
gentleman says on that card

866
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:03,460
this house this this

867
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,260
with Old English who is still in Scots

868
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,780
today so they say moose what about the

869
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,720
accent does that also change over time

870
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,390
we have for example further now in

871
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,820
cockney it's very normal safe I think

872
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,300
but up here it isn't however it is now

873
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:30,000
thank thank

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,650
but inevitably there has been

875
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,290
speculation that it's the media that

876
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,260
it's watching soaps it's watching TV I'm

877
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,090
particularly southern English forms of

878
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,000
TV that are causing these changes but

879
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,980
there's a problem here there's no real

880
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,440
research to actually establish this

881
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,390
empirically have you any examples of

882
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,120
very recent new Glaswegian words the one

883
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,500
that we've been quite excited about is

884
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,820
nip it's a verb and an example of nip

885
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,370
would be I nicked her I saw her nipping

886
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:13,510
him can you think of any words that you

887
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,030
know what it means it seems to mean

888
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,220
something like kiss or smell probably

889
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,930
get off with there's a lot of talk about

890
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,900
this particular time the last 25 the

891
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,600
last 50 years being the period when

892
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,480
region like sense retreated and began to

893
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,270
die what happens do we have for that

894
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,490
here an accent is actually a combination

895
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,510
of features and so you can change

896
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,930
certain features in the same way in

897
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,990
Glasgow and in Redding but because the

898
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,090
original combination of features that

899
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,440
you started off with and Redding in

900
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,030
Glasgow were different although you have

901
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,800
the same changes for some of the

902
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
features the rest the features are quite

903
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,360
different so the resulting mix will

904
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,760
remain distinctive so my feeling from

905
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
looking at glass region at the moment is

906
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,210
that actually glass region will retain

907
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,530
its distinctiveness

908
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,970
as we look back at the adventure of

909
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,890
English we've steamed through centuries

910
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,329
and so we've been able to see sweeping

911
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,339
changes in the vocabulary and the way it

912
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,039
was used but many changes in language

913
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,990
have happened over a long period and in

914
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,150
small steps word by word and sound by

915
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,039
sound so when we look at the way

916
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,380
language is changing now all round us

917
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,359
it's not so easy to see the bigger

918
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:28,339
picture or where the changes are leading

919
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,680
which currents are influences will mark

920
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,230
out the future one of the greatest

921
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,910
causes of change in English has been

922
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,500
extinct and with other cultures and

923
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,809
other tongues these encounters are still

924
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,240
happening today my next stop is Bradford

925
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,650
to see this in action Bradford has one

926
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,299
of the largest concentration of South

927
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,730
Asian populations in Britain they're

928
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,920
about 1.7 million who have come to this

929
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,349
country from South Asia from India

930
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:02,599
Pakistan Bangladesh making it the

931
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,789
biggest ethnic minority many of those

932
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:06,710
who came in the first instance didn't

933
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,569
speak English but as their children were

934
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,549
born here and went through the British

935
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,559
school system they did speak English

936
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,270
they do speak English at school at least

937
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,400
here they speak Yorkshire English

938
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,920
welcome to the tale of a delicious

939
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,549
adventure in a wonderful land Kate but

940
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:24,740
that the name will tell much either way

941
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,680
she barely comes into the story but if

942
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,720
wishes were fishes I'd bet with all

943
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,819
throw them back the first language of

944
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,020
these children's parents and

945
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,210
grandparents is usually who do open job

946
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,799
and that's often the language of the

947
00:43:36,799 --> 00:43:38,599
children speak at home and these

948
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,640
languages are greatly complicated and

949
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,470
enriched the Yorkshire English they

950
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,859
speak at school and on the streets I

951
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:48,230
speak half English and half Punjabi when

952
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,869
I'm talking to my mates if I if I know I

953
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:53,599
can't said this word in English I will

954
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,510
say in my home language means I swear

955
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,380
like I swear I won't do that again

956
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,900
I found with my white friends and you

957
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,369
know like accidentally I would say it

958
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,650
cussed me I really did this and they say

959
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,359
what is cussed me and then I'll say it

960
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,119
means I swear I swear you know I'm being

961
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,859
honest when they use the word curse

962
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,869
middle elven is quite funny the way they

963
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:15,579
say no

964
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:18,459
may not happen you know they'll use the

965
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:20,140
language as well very differently as

966
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:26,529
well for something but they don't know

967
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:31,420
they say the same thing the only well

968
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,369
Punjabi would be use when we text in his

969
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,890
odd the rest is all short English that

970
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,359
you probably use when you're on the

971
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,489
internet sending a message English is

972
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,279
borrowing adopting changing altering

973
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:46,660
words all the time as we've seen

974
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,089
throughout these programs it's a massive

975
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:51,219
job keeping track of them being as it

976
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:54,459
were the keeper of words if anyone body

977
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,140
deserves to be called the keeper of the

978
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,799
English language

979
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,660
it's the Oxford English Dictionary and

980
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,880
that's my next stop we've been

981
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,400
travelling down the country from the

982
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,519
Hebrides south just taking soundings has

983
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,109
taught the languages like these days and

984
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:11,200
I wondered how these figured in the in

985
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,859
your dictionary from the Japanese

986
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:18,400
there's Buddha an old man yeah and I

987
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,839
believe that would actually still is in

988
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,309
it is it is in the Oxford English

989
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,670
Dictionary sense of an old intensive and

990
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,499
it's like earlier sense I'm a suspect

991
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:28,930
our spectral prisons in Glasgow there's

992
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,930
the word nip being used to get off with

993
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,279
it's not in the dictionary yet in that

994
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,229
last sense no we haven't got enough

995
00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:37,749
evidence for it we're looking for fairly

996
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:41,079
fairly extensive evidence from from

997
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,630
Glasgow or elsewhere in Bradford where

998
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,489
the Punjab Ian would do influence the

999
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:49,839
several words casmi meaning I swear

1000
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,779
there's war how is it going anchovies

1001
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:55,059
Underpants shudders is in the OED are

1002
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,829
already possibly from it from a Hindi

1003
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:01,150
word that's but she that's one of these

1004
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,670
wizards achieved some sort of currency

1005
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,049
through the media through television and

1006
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:07,180
the other words that you mentioned you

1007
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,199
know they're not in the dictionary yet

1008
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,749
again this is a borderline area the

1009
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:12,640
interface between cultures it's always

1010
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,150
an interesting area for linguistic

1011
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,739
description and will tend to wait

1012
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,809
several years before a word to find some

1013
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:20,839
sort of

1014
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:22,309
more established place in the language

1015
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:24,229
before we put it into the dictionary the

1016
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:25,640
operation going behind us here is a sort

1017
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,140
of scientific investigation of the

1018
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,150
language evidence starts coming into our

1019
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,950
car files and my computer files which

1020
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,690
we're monitoring and we can see that it

1021
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,729
it's maybe significant because so much

1022
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:37,099
of language is just some sparks that

1023
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,380
disappear let's talk about slang about

1024
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,700
bling bling bling bling

1025
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,890
meaning the ostentatious jewelry or as

1026
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,359
an adjective relating to that

1027
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:46,160
ostentatious wealth for that sort of

1028
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,359
thing it crops up five or six years ago

1029
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,769
but but this stayed around so it's on

1030
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:52,910
the way into the dictionaries not there

1031
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,739
yet but it's on the way and it's been

1032
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:57,140
being reviewed by our revised advisors

1033
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,410
over at the moment what about the

1034
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,119
relation between English English an

1035
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,249
American English and now other languages

1036
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:06,170
the whole concept of different varieties

1037
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,430
of English is obviously more important

1038
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,440
now than it was or more recognized now

1039
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,910
than it was twenty or thirty years ago

1040
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,309
so whereas at the time you might have

1041
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:14,210
thought of British English and American

1042
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,269
English as being the main features on

1043
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,969
the linguistic landscape people talk

1044
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:22,039
about the different Englishes as I sort

1045
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,019
of know you can count these days so you

1046
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:25,849
can have a plural English's with

1047
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:27,079
American English Australian English

1048
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:29,809
Singapore English Indian English etc etc

1049
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,599
and they've all got their own

1050
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,719
characteristics

1051
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,910
so they independent in many ways but

1052
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,940
they also feed into a general sort of

1053
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,920
internet English information what's the

1054
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,049
size of the dictionary at the moment

1055
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:45,440
about seven hundred and fifty thousand

1056
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,869
words this is covering English from the

1057
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,849
anglo-saxon period up to the present day

1058
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:52,819
yes Valley tough require so taking was

1059
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:55,940
in do you ever dispense it was you ever

1060
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,789
let words drop kick them out them we

1061
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,329
have a very simple rule for leaving for

1062
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,469
picking with an addition as we don't

1063
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:05,660
once the words in in the full oxford

1064
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,160
english dictionary it stays there

1065
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,359
because it's part of the history of the

1066
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,239
English language so once it's in it's

1067
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,470
there

1068
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,090
well you got any favorite ones you want

1069
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:27,720
us to take the adventure of English

1070
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,870
began 15 centuries ago when invading

1071
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,210
Germanic tribes brought their dialects

1072
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:41,940
here from mainland Europe English

1073
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,370
survived against the odds facing near

1074
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:46,410
extinction from other invaders and other

1075
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,930
languages before becoming our national

1076
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,690
tongue over the last five centuries as

1077
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,170
we've seen settlement and subjugation

1078
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,480
industry and imperialism armies and art

1079
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,910
have combined to make it a language not

1080
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,000
for this country alone but for the world

1081
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,460
but the adventure has already gone even

1082
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,490
further a quarter of a century ago NASA

1083
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,310
launched its two Voyager probes into

1084
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:18,990
deep space at the end of 2003 they're

1085
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,850
heading out of our solar system in the

1086
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,860
hope of contact with unknown forms of

1087
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,350
life each probe carries a gold-plated

1088
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,470
recorded disk designed to last 4,000

1089
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,990
million years in space and on each disk

1090
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,480
there are brief greetings in 55 of the

1091
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,760
planet's languages the only long message

1092
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,710
recorded by the then secretary of the

1093
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,080
United Nations Kurt Waldheim is in

1094
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,110
English I send greetings on behalf of

1095
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,810
the people of our planet we step out of

1096
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,420
our solar system into the universe

1097
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,570
seeking only peace and friendship to

1098
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,430
teach if we are called upon

1099
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,770
English is on its way to the stars but

1100
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,630
the story of English has also been one

1101
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,790
of constant changes in the language it's

1102
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,100
never stood still as we've seen so if a

1103
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,840
thousand years or more in the future

1104
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,270
people meet life from other planets who

1105
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,160
have learned their 20th century English

1106
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,560
from Voyager it'll sound a strange and

1107
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,450
archaic to English speakers here in the

1108
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,060
future as the earliest anglo-saxon does

1109
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,130
to us today what we got a dinner NER of

1110
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,900
the one field cooling a throng of Hunan

1111
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,740
who the Alpha Lingus Ellen from adore in

1112
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,200
the beginning was the word and the Word

1113
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,340
was with God and the Word was God and

1114
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,860
the Word was made flesh and dwelt among

1115
00:50:42,860 --> 00:51:25,390
us

1116
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,530
you

1117
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,590
you
