1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,750
In 1077 William the Conquerer, ruler of

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,580
Normandy in England ordered 

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,510
the construction of a special building.

4
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,390
It was to be part Palace, part Treasury, 

5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,900
part prison and part fortress. 

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,760
It was the White Tower on the banks of the Thames in London.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,520
 And it was a powerful symbol

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,930
of the way that the Normans were

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,120
imposing themselves on this conquered country.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,890
They hadn't just brought armies

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,720
and architecture to mark their authority,

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,000
that also brought their language. 

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,280
The French vocabulary of power forced 

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,830
its way into the English language. "crown" and

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,470
"court" were both French words. So are "castle"

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,870
and "tower" and the "Barons" who built them.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,809
And so are "obedience" and "justice" "treason" and "prison".

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,630
The Anglo-Saxon Kings had

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,970
governed using the Old English language,

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,100
now the Normans used French and Latin.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,460
English had become the third language in

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,490
its own country, it would take over 300

23
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,760
years to emerge from the shadows.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:53,880


25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,319
In the years following the arrival of

26
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,420
Williams army at Pevensey, the Normans

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,209
tightened their grip on England,

28
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,860
now part of a kingdom that extended across the channel.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,349
Across the land William's men

30
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,660
took over every position of power 

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,620
in the state and in the church. 

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,360
Within 60 years, the monk and historian William of

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,480
Moultrie could write: "no English one

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,720
today is an Earl or Bishop or Abbot, 

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,299
the newcomers gnaw at the wealth and guts of

36
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:29,120
England, nor is there any hope of ending the misery".

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,230
He wrote in Latin. 

38
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,910
Written English which had managed to establish

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:42,730
itself so boldly before the conquest was now dying.

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,900
It breathed its last here. 

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,030
Now Peterborough Cathedral, in the mid-12th century,

42
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,709
part of Peterborough Abbey.

43
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,069
??? two oxen ??? to

44
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,970
the king and he ??? him but ???.

45
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,530
Around the country monks had been

46
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,180
recording the great events of 

47
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,950
the last 650 years in books

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,190
known as the Anglo-Saxon chronicles.

49
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,540
They were written in the language of

50
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,989
the people : English.

51
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,030
And there was nothing like them

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,340
anywhere in mainland Europe. 

53
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,700
??? ??? ???

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,329
Since the Norman conquest of 1066

55
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,299
 these unique accounts

56
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:27,849
had been abandoned one by one. 

57
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,620
The Peterborough Chronicle was the last survivor.

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,970
In 1154 a monk recorded that

59
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,370
the abbey had a new Abbot, a man with a

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,590
very French name of William de Waterville.

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,489
?? chosen ??? named

62
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,810
William de Waterville

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,190
his ??? good ??? and good man and

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,800
??? ??? begun. "He has made a good

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,470
beginning" the monk writes. "Christ is he ??? 

66
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,459
" Christ grant that he may end as well".

67
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,830
With this last entry six and a half

68
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,810
centuries of written history came to an end.

69
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,380
Old English had ceased to be the

70
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,500
language of record in the land. 

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,049
But that didn't mean that it was going to go away.

72
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,850
Since the conquest English in varying

73
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,620
dialects had remained the language

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,290
spoken by 90% of the population, 

75
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,120
from the south coast to the uplands of southern Scotland

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,979
just a few miles north of here.

77
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,990
Even further north in Scotland and

78
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,180
west in Wales the culture and language

79
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,180
were still Celtic. 

80
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,550
Old English had continued to develop and change partly

81
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,410
as a result of contact with the language

82
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,060
of the date particularly here in the north.

83
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,460
The grammar was becoming simpler,

84
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,740
more plurals were being formed by adding

85
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,860
an s. "Naman" for example the Old English

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,919
plural of "name" became "nam-es", which would

87
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,110
become our "names". Prepositions were

88
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,700
performing more of the functions of the

89
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
old word endings and word order was

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,950
becoming more fixed. Despite being the

91
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,229
officially ignored language, English

92
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,150
would continue to evolve and change and

93
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,000
it would endure resisting and absorbing

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,890
the invaders language until the time

95
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,139
came free to resume centre stage as a nation's language.

96
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:17,979


97
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,500
The Peterborough chronicle of 1154 also

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,180
recorded that in that year the people of

99
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,870
England acquired a new king : Count Henry of Anjou,

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,389
 grandson of William the Conqueror,

101
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,949
 and the first of the Plantagenet Kings. 

102
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:33,639


103
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,250
A lover of learning he spoke fluent Latin as well as French but no English. 

104
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,919
And the English acquired 

105
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,949
a new Queen : Eleanor of Aquitaine,

106
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,360
the daughter of William X (the tenth) of Aquitaine.

107
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,379
Henry II was crowned here in

108
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,240
Westminster Abbey in a lavish ceremony.

109
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,969
The clergy wore silk vestments that were

110
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,500
more costly than anything ever seen

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,659
before in England. The King and Queen and

112
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,340
the great Barons wore silk and brocade robes.

113
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,009
The luxury was fitting, 
s
114
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,840
it was thought, for an occasion that solemnised

115
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,759
the bringing together of so much land and wealth.

116
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,550


117
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,680
Henry brought his inheritance of William

118
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,060
the Conqueror's land in England and

119
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,840
northern France.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,300
Eleanor, the greatest heiress 

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,520
in the Western world, brought with her a great sway

122
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,830
 that what is now France 

123
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,750
from the Loire to the Pyrenees, 

124
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,669
from the Rhone to the Atlantic.

125
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,889
This was a huge Kingdom. 

126
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,569
The greater part of it made up of French-speaking lands across the channel. 

127
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:37,849


128
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,669
As it grew the English lands and the English language

129
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,410
became an ever less significant part of it.

130
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,780
French and Latin were even more

131
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,669
firmly entrenched as the languages of

132
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,460
the court and government of the country.

133
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,199
Yet after their coronation, 

134
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,270
Henry and Eleanor rode in procession along the

135
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,789
Strand and it's reported that the people

136
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,240
shouted "Wes hal!" and "Vivat Rex", wishing

137
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,550
them long life in English and in Latin.

138
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,909
English was still alive in the streets.

139
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,020
In the court and royal palaces 

140
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,050
new ideas from across the channel were in the air.

141
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,780
And new words to express them,

142
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,349
words which ???, of "courtesy"(cortesie) and "honor"(honor),  

143
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,690
"questing" and "damsels"(damesieles), "jousting" and "tournaments"(torneiement),

144
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,070
French words everyone. 

145
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,289
The macabre romance and chivalry was heard in England

146
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,650
???

147
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,750
???

148
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,960
???

149
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,699
???

150
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:17,849
???

151
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:21,680
Eleanor， England's new queen was

152
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,300
considered the most cultured woman in Europe.

153
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,169
It was she more than any other

154
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:29,630
who patronized the poets and troubadours

155
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,340
whose verses and songs created the

156
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,919
romantic image of the Middle Ages 

157
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,409
as the age of chivalry, a glorious vision that

158
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,719
was never realized outside the pages of Medieval literature.

159
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,779
A hundred years before,

160
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,570
the word "chevalerie" formed around

161
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,399
the word for horse had simply meant cavalry.

162
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:50,740


163
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,209
It was the fierceness of the mounted warriors

164
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,770
 that had carried the day for

165
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,200
the Normans at Hastings. 

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,089
And since then many English peasants had come to know

167
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,830
the mounted Norman soldiers 

168
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,870
as little more than thugs and bullies 

169
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,630
who run the country by force.

170
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,000
But now mounted warriors had become Knights 

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,830
and the word "chivalry" came to

172
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,540
mean a whole model of ideas and behavior.

173
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,570
Infused with honor and altruism,

174
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,340
one that prescribed how to act towards

175
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,500
one's liege-lord, ones friends and

176
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,510
enemies, and of course fair, cruel ladies.

177
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:46,370
Ideas had shifted, and words with them.

178
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,640
It was in Eleanor's reign that French writers 

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,790
brought the stories of Arthur

180
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,920
and his Knights out of the history books

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,140
and into poetry, cultivating a language

182
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,810
far richer and subtler than the one that

183
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,790
the first Norman settlers had spoken and written.

184
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,010
The poet's rhapsodize about Eleanor, 

185
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,539
celebrating her as 

186
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,120
the most beautiful woman in the world. 

187
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,510
Pouring out the impossible longing for the perfect woman 

188
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,230
that was at the heart of the cult of courtly love.

189
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,000
The poetry of affairs of the heart

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,300


191
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,000
had come to England, singing a pain and joy

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,310
and beginning a line in literature

193
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,870
that runs through Shakespeare's sonnets

194
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,029
and the great Romantic poets to 

195
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,810
today's three-minute pop lyrics.

196
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:36,870
Oh, my love，my darling,

197
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:43,050
I've hungered for your touch

198
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:51,490
A long lonely time.

199
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:02,500
Shit

200
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,769
Meanwhile England's native inhabitant  [BREAK]

201
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,079
That song was first recorded in 1225,

202
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,910
making it one of the earliest pieces of English

203
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,579
that's still recognizable today. 

204
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,769
There's not a single French word in it.

205
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,519
Words like "summer" "come" "sew" "seed" and "nu" can be

206
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,500
traced right back to the flatlands of Frisia.

207
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,500


208
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,779
"spring" and "wood" can be found in the

209
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,720
Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf and "merry" "sing"

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,879
and "loud" in the works authorized by Alfred the Great.

211
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,519
There's a pure line of

212
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,800
Old English vocabulary here in a song

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,389
that comes from the peasants and the land

214
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,829
at the opposite end of the social scale from the troubadour songs. 

215
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,829


216
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,259
The French language of the Grand Lord hasn't

217
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,430
penetrated down to the common people.

218
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,420
Certainly the native English and 

219
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,949
the French overlords live very different lives.

220
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,680
 William the Conqueror had

221
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,000
introduced the system of feudalism into England,

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,579
 and though evolving, 

223
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,000
it still defined all economic and social relations,

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,740
 expressed in French words like

225
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,009
"villain" and "vassal", "laborer", "bailiff" and "factor".

226
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,950


227
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,050
In the country where 95% of 

228
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,030
the population lived, the English were

229
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:19,670
essentially "serfs", another French word.

230
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,950
Not technically slaves, but tied for life

231
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,530
to their Lords estate which they worked for him,

232
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,170
 and at a subsistence level for themselves.

233
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,760
While the English-speaking

234
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,920
peasants lived in small cottages or huts,

235
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,020
their French-speaking masters live

236
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,290
privileged lives in their castles.

237
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,600
Our modern vocabulary still reflects 

238
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,050
the distinction between them. 

239
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,060
English speakers tended the living cattle which

240
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,830
we still call by the Old English words

241
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,470
of "ox" or "cow". French speakers ate the

242
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,540
prepared meat which came to the table

243
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,790
which we call by the French word "beef".

244
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,800
In the same way the English "sheep" became 

245
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
a French "mutton", "calf" became "veal", 

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,090
"deer" "venison" and "pig" "pork".  

247
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,240
English animal, French meat in every case.

248
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:20,200
The English laboured, the French feasted.

249
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,459
Where English underlings and 

250
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,680
French masters lived and worked together, 

251
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,180
the boundaries between their languages

252
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,430
inevitably wore away, and the vocabularies

253
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,470
??? countryside mingle.

254
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,910
For example a local man would have been

255
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,589
involved in the training and flying of a nobleman's hawks. 

256
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:40,240


257
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,339
And some now common words have come to us from for falconry.

258
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,110
The word "Falcon" itself comes from French.

259
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,649
As there's a "leash" which refer to the

260
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,890
strip of material used to secure the bird.

261
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,779
And "block" on which the bird stood.

262
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,210


263
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,070
Our word "codger" comes from the often elderly man

264
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,810
who assisted the falconer by carrying

265
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,600
the hawks on a "cadge" or cage; 

266
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,940
"Bate" described the bird beating its wings and

267
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,300
trying to fly away; 

268
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,420
"check" meant at first refusing to come to the fist.

269
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,029
Our word "lure" comes from the leather device 

270
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,580
still used in training and recalling the hawk.

271
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,170
"Quarry" was the reward given to 

272
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,230
the Falcon for making a kill. 

273
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,750
When a bird moulted it was said to "mew" and from that

274
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,490
came the name of the buildings where Hawks were kept : "Mews". 

275
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,710
Today that name can

276
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,000
still be seen attached to streets or(???) estate agents

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,730
 rather than hawks hunt(???) their quarry.

278
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,430


279
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,530
We've just heard 9 French words that

280
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,000
came into English from one activity alone.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,840
Steadily French vocabulary was pouring over English. 

282
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,000


283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,650
The French influence on the English language as a

284
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,650
whole is enormous in terms of vocabulary,

285
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,650
not in terms of grammar, but in terms of

286
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,600
a vocabulary, it's unmatched by any other language.

287
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,840
For example "fruit" replaces the

288
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,600
old English "wæstm", pretty quickly at

289
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,610
within a space of about 40 or 50 years,

290
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,520
"wæstm" simply isn't used.

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,710
But the majority of words don't replace 

292
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,570
the Old English, they stand side by side with them.

293
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,930
So we have word like "apple" in Old English,

294
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,230
meant any kind of fruit.

295
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,330
Whereas what happens is because "fruit" comes in

296
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,000
and is basically expresses that 

297
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,670
"apple" starts to mean a very specific sort of a fruit.

298
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,830
I think it's not true to say that

299
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,120
generally speaking French words came

300
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,700
into the language and ousted the Old English words out of it. 

301
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,070
Generally what seems to happen

302
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,420
 is that the the Old English words

303
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,470
 simply narrows in meaning.

304
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,030
It was now almost 150 years since the Norman Conquest.  

305
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,400
Though the people at the top had changed, 

306
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,490
the ascendancy of French was still absolute.

307
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,160
Written English, that triumphant achievement of Alfred and

308
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,160


309
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,200
English scholars was dead. 

310
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,510
And spoken English was being progressively

311
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,500
colonized throughout society by French words.

312
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,180
But the balance of power and of languages was about to shift.

313
00:16:50,180 --> 00:17:09,160


314
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,319
Of course early 13th century English society consisted of more than 

315
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,319


316
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,790
English peasants grubbing the land and

317
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,890
French-speaking nobility lording it in their castles.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
Trade was on the increase,

319
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,990
The wool trade, in particular, made part of England rich. 

320
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:26,990


321
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,820
On the proceeds grand churches were built,  

322
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,540
Even in small villages like this one, at Northleach in the Cotswolds.

323
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,550
Services would of course be conducted in Latin.

324
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,550


325
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,160
Towns were growing, sometimes French and

326
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,020
English towns together as at Norwich and Nottingham

327
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,270


328
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,490
Then as now London was the magnet.

329
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,320
Its population would double in the course of the 13th century.

330
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,530
As feudalism loosened its grip,

331
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,020
 English speakers would flood in

332
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,000
from the country looking for opportunities, 

333
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,429
a better life.

334
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,209
Already established with 

335
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,709
the French-speaking court officials,

336
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,229
administrators, lawyers and merchants, 

337
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,209
but also craftsmen who gave us the French

338
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,719
names for some tools of the trade:

339
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:43,929
"measure" "mallet" "chisel" "pulley" "bucket"  "trowel".

340
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:49,510


341
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,580
This is petit France in London, 

342
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,590
it's name shows that it originally housed 

343
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,780
a community of French immigrants. 

344
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,430
In the early Middle Ages, there were areas like

345
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,260
this in many English towns, 

346
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,070
home to craftsmen and merchants who'd come here from Normandy.

347
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,070


348
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,840
English and French speakers met and mingled in these places

349
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,270
and the English middle classes picked up

350
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,000
French words by the thousand. 

351
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,100
"merchant", "money", "price", "discount", "bargain", "contract",

352
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,240
"partner", "embezzle". 

353
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,310
The English didn't just borrow French vocabulary they took their names.

354
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,190
Then as now names were a matter of fashion,

355
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,190
 

356
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,000
and the fashion in the early 13th century was for French. 

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,940
So out went the good Old English Ethelbert

358
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,790
Aelfrics, Athelstans, Dunstans, Wulfstans and Wulfrics.

359
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:38,790


360
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,290
And in came the newfangled Richards and Roberts 

361
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,840
Simons and Stephens Jones Jeffries,  

362
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,520
and most popular of all Williams. 

363
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,090
It seemed that everywhere French was the name of the game.

364
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,700

365
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,440
If this process had continued well by

366
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,570
French percolated and penetrated into

367
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,730
every area of English society, 

368
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,400
then French could eventually have engulfed English.

369
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,510
That didn't happen, why not ? 

370
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,130
One critical reason was that because of

371
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,260
particular historical events， 

372
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,210
French speakers in England became cut off from

373
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,760
their cultural and linguistic roots.

374
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,000
In 1204, the reigning Monarch John, 

375
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
King of Normandy Aquitaine and England,

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
lost his Norman lands in a war with a much smaller kingdom of France.

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,840


378
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,820
The Norman dukedoms, ancestral lands of William the Conqueror

379
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,980
and cultural homelands were part of another Empire now.

380
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,770


381
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,720
As long as the French nobility and

382
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,580
middle classes who live in England kept

383
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,650
contact with their homelands in Normandy

384
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,000
as long as they thought of themselves as French

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 and married within French families,

386
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,530
their identity and language were secure.

387
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,800
When they lost their connections across the channel,

388
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,800


389
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,830
their language began to lose its grip on English.

390
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,860
One thing that happened was that

391
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,760
French speakers, even within the noblest families,

392
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,280
began to look for wives 

393
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,820
not from across the channel but in England.

394
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,540
They married English speakers, 

395
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,900
and in doing so they married, as it were, 

396
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,040
into the English language as well. 

397
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,450
It said that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.

398
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,450


399
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,070
It's likely that by the middle of the 13th century,

400
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,470
many children in families 

401
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,940
which would previously have been French-speaking,

402
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,000
 

403
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:44,810
were learning English from their mothers or nurses.

404
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:51,690
???

405
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,230
???

406
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,460
???

407
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,860
???

408
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:17,8
Now that many of the

409
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,679
children of Anglo-French marriages grew up

410
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,659
bilingual, perhaps speaking one

411
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,220
language to the servants in the castle

412
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,169
kitchen and another at dinner in the

413
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:31,440
Great Hall. By 1250 there's even

414
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
some evidence that children of the

415
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,890
nobility were having to learn French

416
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,289
from a written primer grappling with the

417
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,029
vocabulary of what was becoming

418
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:43,020
effectively a foreign language by the

419
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,730
middle of the thirteenth century. More

420
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,320
and more French speakers throughout

421
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,360
society with themselves beginning to

422
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,149
speak English, becoming bilingual. the

423
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,159
result was that while French itself

424
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,380
became more of a foreign language. French

425
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,230
vocabulary French words continued to

426
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,720
stream into English. Many more words are

427
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,350
recorded after 1250 than before ： "abbey"

428
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,210
"attire" "sensor" "defend" "figure" "malady" "music"

429
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,370
"parson" "plea" "sacrifice" "scarlet" "spy" "stable"

430
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:19,289
"virtue" "Marshall" "Park" "rain" "beauty" "clergy"

431
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:24,630
"cloak" "country" "fool"

432
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,820
and because French was the international language of trade，

433
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,250
it acted as a conduit

434
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,820
for words from the markets of the East.

435
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,700
Arabic words that gave to the English

436
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,870
"saffron" "mattress" "hazard" "camphor" "alchemy"

437
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:48,570
"lute" "amber" and "syrup" 

438
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,269
Our phrase "checkmate" comes through French from the

439
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:58,080
Arabic "shah mat" - the king is dead. 

440
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,879
As we've heard very often the imports didn't

441
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,950
replace existing English words but

442
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,720
settled down with them, 

443
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,399
each word adopting a slightly different meaning.

444
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,740
The same thing had happened with English

445
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,129
and Old Norse, this layering effect, 
re
446
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:15,020
So a young English "hare" came to be named by the French word "leveret",

447
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,230


448
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,679
English "swan" French "signet", 

449
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,039
a small English "axe" is a French "hatchet", 

450
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,779
"ask" English and "demand" from French have slightly different meanings 

451
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:28,379
as do "bit" and "morsel", "wish" and "desire"

452
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:32,549
"might" and "power", "room" and "chamber".

453
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:35,100
On the surface some of these words

454
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,570
appear to be interchangeable and

455
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,070
sometimes they are. 

456
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,379
But more interestingly there are fine differences,

457
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,169
that's the beauty of it. 

458
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,899
"answer" is not quite "respond" 

459
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:48,960
"begin" isn't always "commence", "liberty" isn't always "freedom".

460
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,570
Shades of meaning representing new shades of thought

461
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:52,639
 

462
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:56,059
were massively absorbed into our language at that time.

463
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,289
The range of what I would call almost synonyms

464
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,570
became one of the glories of

465
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,700
English, contributing to the languages

466
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,039
precision and flexibility, allowing its

467
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,870
speakers and writers over the centuries

468
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,980
to select very precisely the right word.

469
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,049
Rather than replace English, French was

470
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,059
helping equip and enrich the language

471
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,340
for the central role that it was on its

472
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,880
way to reassuming.

473
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,380
Towards the end of the 13th century 

474
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,390
a new idea of the English people is being born,

475
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,510
the Norman lands across the channel

476
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,789
were a foreign country now, 

477
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,590
even the families who traced their roots back to

478
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,150
William the Conqueror's Norman followers,

479
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,970
men with French names and French blood

480
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,590
started calling themselves trueborn Englishman.

481
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,690
Behind me is the tomb of Edward I

482
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,120
- the hammer of the Scots,it says there in Latin.

483
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,419
Latin was the language of

484
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,640
official business, but when the French

485
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:60,230
King Philip threatened invasion of England in 1295,

486
00:25:60,230 --> 00:26:02,440
Edward used the English language

487
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,960
 as a symbol of nationhood to galvanize support

488
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,200
"If Philip is able to do 

489
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,179
all the evil he means to from which

490
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:11,169
God protect us,

491
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,480
he plans to wipe out our English

492
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,450
language entirely from the earth" he said.

493
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,150
The old language reborn could now be a

494
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,870
rallying point for a new mongrel people.

495
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,059
The invasion never came, 

496
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,620
and though Edward made the English language 

497
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,539
a symbol for the country, 

498
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,630
he didn't elevate it to official use, 

499
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,240
Latin and French were still the languages of state affairs

500
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,070
It was Edward's direct ancestor 

501
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,750
William the Conqueror who more than two

502
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,210
centuries before had enshrined Latin and French

503
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,330
 as a written languages of state,

504
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,720
banishing English.

505
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,850
But as the 13th century gave way to the 14th,

506
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,370
 English was becoming the one

507
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,440
language out of the three that everyone

508
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,940
in the country could be counted on to know.

509
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,240
In 1325 for instance, the

510
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,070
chronicler William of Nassington

511
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,240
could write : "Latin can no one speak, as I trowe 

512
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,370
But those wit from school do know.

513
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,700
And some know French but not Latin,

514
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,710
who used to court and dwell therein.

515
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,279
and some know Latin though just in part

516
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,940
whose use of French is less than art 

517
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,039
and some can understand English 

518
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,789
who neither Latin nor French 

519
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,080
but unlettered or learned, old or young, 

520
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,230
all understand the English tongue. "

521
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,029
The bestiary in which birds and animals were

522
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,679
portrayed and their behavior made the

523
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,539
basis for lessons in Christian morality

524
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,549
was a particular medieval form. 

525
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,029
They were usually written as here in Latin, 

526
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:53,820
but in a late 13th century example 

527
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,240
the text is not in Latin but it English

528
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,090
 the wild deer has two properties

529
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,070
he draws out the Viper from the stone

530
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,250
with his nose and swallows it 

531
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,669
a venom causes the deer to burn and he rushes to the water 

532
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,659
the devil is like the whale 

533
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,480
he tempts men to follow their sinful lusts

534
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,870
and in return they find ??. 

535
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,059
It is the weak in faith the little ones

536
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,759
that he thus beguiles 

537
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,179
And it was an animal

538
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,429
which in just a few years time, would by

539
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:28,500
a cruel twist of fate, give English its

540
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,889
greatest boost yet, a small black rodent

541
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:37,020
with a Latin name

542
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:45,390
Rattus Rattus the black rat. 

543
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,040
In 1348 ancestors of these black rats deserted a

544
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,750
ship that coming from the continent had

545
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,490
docked near Weymouth they carried a

546
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,250
deadly cargo a germ then modern science

547
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,250
calls Pasteurella pestis that the 14th

548
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,620
century named the great pestilence and

549
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,760
that we know is the Black Death plague

550
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,870
had come to Britain infected rats

551
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,650
carried the deadly germ East than North

552
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,179
they sought out human habitations

553
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,270
building nests in the flaws climbing the

554
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,800
wattle and daub walls shedding the

555
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,720
infected fleas that fed on their blood

556
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,429
and transmitted bubonic plague

557
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,920
this is Asheville in Hertfordshire in

558
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,620
the bell tower of the church some

559
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,809
desperate soul perhaps the parish priest

560
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,059
scratched a poignant record on the wall

561
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:39,000
in bad Latin

562
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,780
the first pestilence was in 1350 - 11350

563
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:49,440
pitiless wild violent only the dregs of

564
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,330
the people live to tell the tale

565
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,740
the dregs were those of the

566
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,450
english-speaking peasantry who'd

567
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,940
survived though the black death was a

568
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,250
human catastrophe it's setting trend a

569
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,470
series of social upheavals which would

570
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,270
speed the English language along the

571
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,490
road to full restoration as the real and

572
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:19,530
recognized language of the nation for

573
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,360
one thing the Black Death dealt Latin

574
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,340
the language of the church a body blow

575
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,140
where people live communally as the

576
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,700
clergy did in monasteries and other

577
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,470
religious orders the incidence of

578
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,580
infection and death was

579
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,960
disproportionately high at a local level

580
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,850
many parish priests either caught the

581
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,110
plague from tending their parishioners

582
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,990
or simply ran away as a result of the

583
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,539
plague the Latin speaking clergy in some

584
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,100
parts of England were reduced by almost

585
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,779
a half

586
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,909
many of their replacements were barely

587
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,249
literate layman whose only language was

588
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:25,020
English

589
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,970
the England after the Black Death was a

590
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,240
very different place in many parts of

591
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,870
the country

592
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,669
those hardly anyone left to work the

593
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:35,760
land or tender livestock the acute

594
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,740
shortage of labour meant that those who

595
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,049
did the work had the power to break from

596
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,700
their feudal past and demand better

597
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,130
conditions higher wages times were

598
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:59,150
changing

599
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,780
wages rose the price of property fell

600
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,190
working people seize the opportunities

601
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,970
they've never had before the fortunes of

602
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,370
the common people were changing they

603
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,500
were rising through society and they

604
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,680
took their English with them

605
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,770
by 1385 English had replaced French in

606
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,480
the schoolroom and his education and

607
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,670
literacy spread so did the demand for

608
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,310
books in English. And English was already

609
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,830
finding a place in the state and in the

610
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,900
law in 1362 for the first time in three

611
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,090
centuries English was acknowledged as a

612
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,210
language of official business since the

613
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,520
conquest court cases have been heard in

614
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,460
French now the law recognized the too

615
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,200
few people understood that language

616
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,000
probably because many of the educated

617
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,640
lawyers had died in the play from now on

618
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,950
it was declared cases could be pleaded

619
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,560
showed defended debated and judged in

620
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,460
English in the same year 1362 parliament

621
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,800
was opened here at Westminster for the

622
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,170
first time ever the Chancellor addressed

623
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,210
the assembly not in French but in

624
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,060
English while the worship and honor of

625
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,970
God King Edward had something at his

626
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,970

Lords of Israel to its parliament hold

628
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,330
on at Westminster the year of the king

629
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,480
six and soon English would once again be

630
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,420
the language of Kings the country hadn't

631
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,800
had an english-speaking monarch since

632
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,300
Herald have been hacked to death at

633
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,800
Hastings in 1066 in 1399 king richard ii

634
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,680
was deposed by henry duke of lancaster

635
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,090
parliament was summoned here to the

636
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,490
Great Hall at Westminster the Dukes and

637
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,080
Lords Spiritual and temple were

638
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,270
assembled the royal throne draped in

639
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,970
cloth of gold stood empty then Henry

640
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,040
stepped forward crossed himself and

641
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,530
claimed the crown and in a great

642
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,200
symbolic moment he made his speech not

643
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,940
in the Latin language of state business

644
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,710
or the French language of the royal

645
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,810
household but in what the official

646
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:06,350
history calls his mother tongue English

647
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,810
in the Nama of the hardy our son and

648
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,060
holy ghost II Henry of Lancaster

651
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,790
appurtenances as either

Henry third and fourth not reached that

once again a royal language the tide

663
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,579
seemed to be turning in its favour by

664
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,650
the end of the 14th century it was on

665
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,810
course to regain its status as the first

666
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,970
language of the country and now it also

667
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,650
had a literary champion who could

668
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,599
harness its full capabilities to produce

669
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:39,430
great writing Geoffrey Chaucer won that

Chaucer wrote those opening shower

684
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,660
aligns to the Canterbury Tales more than

685
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,359
six centuries ago in 1387 for millions

686
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,650
of people since the canterbury tales

687
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,930
have been the flowering of the medieval

688
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,060
english language and also a great

689
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,619
staging post for english literature

690
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:41,210
Chaucer pictured here as one of his own

691
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,250
pilgrims wasn't the only writer of his

692
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,050
time and he didn't invent the language

693
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,270
he was working with but he more than any

694
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,580
other recognize its richness the

695
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,410
potential in having at his disposal by

696
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,480
cabbage some high and low society

697
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,460
brought from French and Old English and

698
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:02,090
he worked it to the full Chaucer was a

699
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,010
Londoner and an important man with

700
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,690
connections to the royal family and a

701
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,260
high position in the civil service he

702
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,390
troubled widely perhaps even been a spy

703
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,619
and he knew Latin and French might have

704
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:17,420
been expected like many other English

705
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,070
boats at the time to write it either of

706
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,359
those languages for an exclusive

707
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:23,750
audience but he didn't he chose to write

708
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,119
in English the English that was spoken

709
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,380
in London the language of London would

710
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,359
have been a huge mixture you've got

711
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,730
people coming in from the central

712
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,740
Midler's from the northern Midlands from

713
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,180
the northern Minnesota bringing more

714
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,130
Scandinavian terms because it's an area

715
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,740
of strong Scandinavian settlement but

716
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,600
we'd have also have heard French

717
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,010
loanwords which people would have heard

718
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,010
in literature as well so it's it's it's

719
00:37:49,010 --> 00:38:08,029
a vibrant variety of English

720
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:11,520

dismal backyard of guy's hospital this

728
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,079
is where Chaucer's pilgrims gather

729
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,460
before setting out on their pilgrimage

730
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,589
to Canterbury the buildings may have

731
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:39,630
gone but Chaucer's characters are

732
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,490
connealy constructed cross section of

733
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,160
medieval society live on in his writing

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,960
a quiche there was and that a ward a man

735
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,079

read a note hail Ovid chivalry truth

merchant was there with a forked bird in

Mott LA and he owned horses at a good

741

whiff was there of BC the baths but she

Miller was astute car for the Nonna's

744
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,859
full big he was a brown and a cook who's

745
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,589
the pilgrim set off for Canterbury

746
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:33,390
journey of about three days then and to

747
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,529
pass the time they told each other

748
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:36,480
stories the stories have a range of

749
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,549
styles from serious moral fables to

750
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:41,220
bawdy farces with episodes that wouldn't

751
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,619
be out of place in a carry on film what

752
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,750
Chaucer did most brilliantly was to

753
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,970
choose and tailor his the language to

754
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,250
suit every tale and its teller the

755
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,140
creation of mood and tone and the

756
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,760
realization of characters through the

757
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,980
language is something we expect the

758
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,869
writers today so it's difficult to

759
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:59,460
realize how extraordinary was when

760
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,940
Chaucer did it he showed he proved that

761
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,319
reformed English was fit for great

762
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,329
literature which gives him a key part in

763
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:10,319
our story. This gentil cok hadde in his

771
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,380
language is predominating in this

772
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,810
particular passage we've got so many

773
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,610
French were suddenly they really hit you

774
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,200
between the eyes even today I think

775
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,420
you'd noticed some governance

776
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,260
please danse paramore in fact a Chaucer

777
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,780
is is thought to be the person who

778
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,880
introduced Pariwar into the English

779
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,860
language himself and those words

780
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,800
Plaisance governance all appear from

781
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,500
about the 1350 so they're quite new at a

782
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,960
time when she'll sir use them in nuns

783
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,030
priests ale questioners courses why is

784
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,670
he doing this well it's odd really isn't

785
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,110
it because this is a story about

786
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,320
chickens it's true about a cock and his

787
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,970
hens and you thought that perhaps a a

788
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,160
less refined language might be in order

789
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,800
but choice was playing with a whole idea

790
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,580
of an exalted style and so he's he's

791
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,760
investing these these hens and cocks

792
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,640
with a feeling of great literary quality

793
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,580
you know it becomes almost a mock epic

794
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,140
Chaucer not only used existing French

795
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,570
words for poetic effect he also

796
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,870
introduced his own elevated synonyms

797
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,550
sometimes bypassing an English word in

798
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:52,980
favor of a more stylish French boring so

799
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,170
English had the perfectly good hard as a

800
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,410
noun

801
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,200
Chaucer bored the French word difficulty

802
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,660
in place of unhappy he gave us this

803
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,770
adventure for shin ship dishonesty for

804
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,370
building edifice for uncommon ignorant

805
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:17,120
and for meaning significance but Chaucer

806
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,920
wasn't just ensnared with the elegance

807
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,670
of French

808
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,740
he also cherished the directness and

809
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,600
earthiness of English and used it for

810
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,760
example in the Millers tale where the

811
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,710
student absalon's midnight assignation

812
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,080
with the neighbor's wife doesn't go

813
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,040
quite according to plan this epsilon can

814
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,640
weep his mouthful dream there was the

815
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,780
neat as pitch or as the coal and at the

816
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,720
window would she put her whole and

817
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,060
epsilon him feel no better worse but

818
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,550
with his mouth he kissed her naked airs

819
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,690
the language of course is predominately

820
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,420
Old English and again Chaucer is aware

821
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,760
of what linguist would call register he

822
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,050
knows that you have to have a particular

823
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,140
style for a particular purpose with

824
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,450
Miller's tail we have both the Miller

825
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,760
himself who is a man of extraordinary

826
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,800
quality so he opens doors simply by

827
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,210
running at them with his head which is a

828
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,360
clever trick and the story itself is as

829
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,280
you know about bottoms out of windows

830
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,080
another such thing and of course in that

831
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,110
case it's appropriate to have a simple

832
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,870
earthy style he knows that if he's

833
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,750
talking about basic earthy stuff he

834
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,540
might as well use good old English words

835
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,610
and I think it's actually mark that used

836
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,500
by not using many French words I think

837
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,420
people would have picked up on that we

838
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,030
certainly do the style seems very direct

839
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,070
almost colloquial of course that's

840
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,920
literary artifice but it does seem

841
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,900
direct and colloquial and that's as a

842
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,540
complete result of the way in which he's

843
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,250
using the language the language he'd

844
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,320
have heard on the street words like s

845
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,200
meaning ass I'm afraid and other such

846
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,269
rude words

847
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,319
scholars dispute how much vocabulary

848
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:01,920
Chaucer actually introduced into English

849
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,910
with Old English he certainly

850
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,920
reintroduced words which hadn't been

851
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,499
written down since before 1100 probably

852
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:09,400
because they weren't considered

853
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,219
important or seemly enough words like

854
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,089
churlish farting friendly learning

855
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:20,380
loving restless sway Vern wasp wifely and

856
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,989
willingly. The brilliant Archbishop son

857
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:28,059
of a French merchant had been brutally

858
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,309
murdered in 1170 by Knights acting on

859
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:32,170
the wishes if not instructions of Henry

860
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,599
the second that first Plantagenet whose

861
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:36,789
wife Eleanor had done so much to promote

862
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:38,499
to the courtly French language which

863
00:44:38,499 --> 00:44:49,980
Chaucer was now mining so expertly

864
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,600
in Chaucer's day this area around the

865
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,310
cathedral and the nearby streets would

866
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,930
have been thronged with pilgrims from

867
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,010
all over the country

868
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,590
well the thronging hasn't changed but

869
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,000
they would have been speaking in the

870
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,430
dialect of their homes English wasn't

871
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,740
uniform in the way it was spoken and

872
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,140
Chaucer himself in the reves tale gives

873
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,210
us literature's first fully northerner

874
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,040
who speaks with flat vowels

875
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,240
he says him for home now for no gong for

876
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,330
gone and nan for non all pronunciations

877
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,100
that will be quite understandable in the

878
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,590
northeast of England today

879
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,270
Chaucer himself worried about whether

880
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,980
his work would be mispronounced or

881
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,260
wrongly copied or just misunderstood in

882
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,660
other parts of the country he bids one

883
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,790
of his poems Troilus and Cressida I

884
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,160
rather worried farewell voicing a

885
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,140
concern in a sorcerer felt for The

886
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,670
Canterbury Tales go little book and for

887
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,100
there is so great diversity in English

888
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,890
and in a reading of all tongue so try

of course Chaucer's books particularly

894
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,890
The Canterbury Tales were understood his

895
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,869
language the language of late 14th

896
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,060
century London would become with some

897
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,430
later modifications the standard form of

898
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,220
English and is genius in harnessing that

899
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,109
language to serve his vision as a writer

900
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,510
would guarantee that it lived on a

901
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,589
century and a half after his death

902
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:27,599
Geoffrey Chaucer was famous enough for

903
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,720
this tomb to be put in Westminster Abbey

904
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,550
in intervening years his tales had

905
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,410
spread around the country and delighted

906
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,880
listeners and readers ranging from

907
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,040
London merchants to the future Richard

908
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,440
the third before the 15th century

909
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,210
resulted the canterbury tales had been

910
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,670
printed by thomas Caxton ensuring the

911
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,119
future

912
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,920
Chaucer's work and furthering the

913
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,510
process by which southern English

914
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,460
sources English would become the

915
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,760
standard Chaucer was the first poet to

916
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,980
be buried here in what's become Poets

917
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,460
Corner

918
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,650
it's appropriate for the man who not

919
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,420
only entertained and delighted in his

920
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,460
own work but who through expanding the

921
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,810
capabilities of the English language

922
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,930
created a standard and a platform for

923
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:23,350
those who followed
