00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,149
the age of reason which began in the

19
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,640
late 17th century was born out of years

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,740
of massive political upheaval in Britain

21
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,200
it had seen civil war during which the

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,479
King left London and set up court here

23
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,270
at Christ's Church College Oxford the

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,340
war made familiar such words and phrases

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,220

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,879
the philosopher John Locke was educated

32
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,439
here at Christ Church and lived through

33
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,750
this turmoil he developed his greatest

work in the 1670s an atheist an essay

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,239
concerning human understanding in it he

36
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,579
argued that better use of language could

37
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,379
put an end to disputes and factionalism

38
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,569
if the definition of words could be

39
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,700
agreed and misunderstanding avoided

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,959
peace would naturally follow it's a

41
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,359
wonderful example of rational idealism

42
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,000
did John Locke a man of such supreme

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,340
intelligence really believe that by

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,170
getting the language clear and the

45
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,180
arguments stripped to basic simplicity's

46
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,109
then as he put it

47
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,019
disputes would end of themselves clearly

48
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,139
he did there is blind faith here at the

49
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,659
heart of what seems pure reason it's a

50
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,670
fascination in this story though the men

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,709
of Locke's calibre did think that in

52
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,799
effect language was the master of life

53
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:25,000
perhaps it could rule everything

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,709
Locke was a member of the Royal Society

55
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,439
founded in 1660 to promote what we call

56
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,450
science but they called physico

57
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,060
mathematical experimental learning they

58
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,069
tried to write pure and simple English

59
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:39,769
to avoid what they described as this

60
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,049
vicious abundance of phrase this

61
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,709
volubility of tongue at the time learn

62
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,450
ed books were usually written in Latin

63
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,069
because Latin was understood

64
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,659
internationally and was regarded as more

65
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,790
precise the members of the Royal Society

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,859
wanted to make English a fit language

67
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,840
for scholars and English began to make

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,629
inroads into the territory of Latin

69
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,010
Newton had published his Principia

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,730
Mathematica in 1687 in Latin but in 1704

71
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,799
his optics was published written in

72
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,169
English a new kind of rational English

73
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,299
larded with terms of inquiry and

74
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,359
argument I proceeded by this analysis to

75
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,070
discover and prove the original

76
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,289

82
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:38,890
their reflections and colors depend

83
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,930
here was a new vocabulary of reason and

84
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,990
investigation refrán ability and reflex

85
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,570

86
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,370
allow him to describe his experiments

87
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,100
with refraction and reflection

88
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,210
transmission had been used before to

89
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,580
mean passing from one place to another

90
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,070
Newton changed its meaning to describe

91
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,710
passing through a medium and opaque had

92
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,680
met unlit for 200 years before the 17th

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,750
century changed it to mean not allowing

94
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,450
the passage of light the word Lenz had

95
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,160
only been coined a decade before Newton

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,410
use it in his book and as he reported

97
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,030
his observations he also gave English

98
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,400
the terms in distinctness and well

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,160
defined the scholars were reframing

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,380
redefining and refashioning the language

101
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,720
they made it part of their apparatus and

102
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,490
there's another word that took on its

103
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,900
meaning is the equipment for an

104
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,920
experiment during this period

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,570
there appeared to be a growing and

106
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,890
general confidence in the state of

107
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,380
English printing presses were no longer

108
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,210
licensed and they it spread and

109
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,550
proliferated for the first time daily

110
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,990
newspapers would be printed and

111
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,750
circulated reports of events around the

112
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,940
globe went into the hands of ordinary

people the fashionable meeting places of

114
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,300
the day were the coffee houses it was in

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,160
places like this that people read and

116
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,940
talked about the news this one sold

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,400
coffee until just a decade ago now it

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,750
serves up stronger fur printed English

119
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,700
and become part of the fabric of daily

121
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,530
the first issue of the daily current for

122
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,470
March the 11th 1700 and too the news

123
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,150
comes from the wall of the Spanish

125
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,310
over 20,000 troops to Italy there was a

126
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,680
massive appetite for this news shows of

127
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Addis until the readers of his magazine

128
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,460
The Spectator the different papers

129
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,320
cooked to the same news in different

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,960
ways and that no one could bear to leave

131
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,060
coffee houses like this one before they

132
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,420
read all the different versions but

133
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,710
coexisting with the exuberance of grub

134
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,720
Street and the coffeehouses possibly as

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,490
a result of it there was a deep anxiety

136
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,950
about the state of the English language

137
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,930
there was no royal society here

138
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,730
protecting English from vicious

139
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,890
abundance of phrase and vulnerability of

140
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,170
tongue there was no John Locke pressing

141
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,000
the case for agreed definitions and

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,920
clarity of meaning the greatest worry

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,400
was that English itself was changing the

144
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
poet Geoffrey Chaucer was still revered

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
three centuries up to he'd written the

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,880
canterbury tales but by then he'd become

147
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,220
difficult to understand the satirist

148
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,080
Jonathan Swift writer of a series of

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,030
bogus trouble Diaries we know today as

150
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,660
Gulliver's Travels voiced his concern

151
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,160
how then shall any man be able to

152
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
undertake his work with spirit and

153
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,630
cheerfulness when he considers that in

154
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,580
an age or two he shall hardly be

155
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,490

aristocracy couldn't be relied on to set

157
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,170
the example Swift hated the vulgar

158
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,790
liberties as he saw it that they were

159
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,650
taking with the English language the way

160
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,330
they clipped vowels out of words or

161
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,560
abbreviated them

crude and swift also hated what he

170
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,120
thought of as merely modish words like

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
banter bubble bully cutting shuffling

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,480
Parman and Shan Swift found a model in

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,520
the classical languages Latin in Greek

174
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,530
those languages that was thought had

175
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,110
survived because they never changed they

176
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,950
were carved in stone Swift would save

177
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,260
English by arresting it putting an end

178
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,660
to changes he would take control of

179
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,580
English and take it away from the

180
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,190
anarchy of the upper-class Bloods on

181
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,330
their slang in 1712 swift proposed the

182
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,580
foundation of an academy for correcting

183
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,979
improving and ascertaining the English

184
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,170
tongue the Academy would replace the

185
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,630
aristocracy ascertain was the big word

186
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,150
English was to be fixed ascertained

187
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,580
forever no matter that the French

188
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,530
Italians already had academies that had

189
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,940
failed to halt changes in their

190
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,100
languages Swift's determination was

191
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,010
ferocious one critic sneered that he was

192
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,660
attempting the impossible and he said

193
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,330
may as well set up a society to find out

194
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,490
the grand alexia the perpetual motion

195
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,950
the lowly to does to fix our language

196
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,860
beyond our own times well it was wrong

197
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,220
about longitude Swift even took this

198
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,020
case to court and proposed his scheme to

199
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,480
Queen Anne saying that only classical

200
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,730
English would endure to report her glory

201
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,700
but she died two years later and her

202
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,410
place on the throne was taken by George

203
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,930
the first the German king who spoke

204
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,970
little English and cared about it even

205
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,949
less Swift's plans were dead

206
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:40,709
but English fielded another champion an

207
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,000
intimidating scholar the monarch of

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,160
London widths a beacon of his age a

209
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,319
savage melancholic and like Isaac Newton

210
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:56,079
and effortless eccentric he lived and

211
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,269
created his master work in this house in

212
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,370
Goff Square just off Fleet Street in

213
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,779
London

214
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,670
Camby are came dr. Samuel Johnson when

215
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,189
his great dictionary

216
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,329
he thought he could write it in three

217
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:12,699
years when it was put to him that it had

218
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,160
taken 40 Frenchmen 40 years to compile

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,860
their dictionary he replied 40 times 40

220
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,939
s 1600 as 3 to 1600 so is the proportion

221
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:32,050
of an Englishman to a Frenchman

222
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,210
in fact it took him seven years and this

223
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,200
is where he did it in this Garret on the

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,280
top floor of this house he fed material

225
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,380
43,000 words and definitions etymologies

226
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,850
and quotations showing how they were

227
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,400
used to six assistants who wrote them

228
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,080
down

229
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,890
Johnson's achievement with the

230
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,780
dictionary was immense and immensely

231
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,420
idiosyncratic he left out proper names

232
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,940
he included obsolete words if they were

233
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,220
found in authors not obsolete and was

234
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,990
criticized for including archaic words

235
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,290
such as Digg l'addition cubicle Larry in

236

Kompas ability job an owl and opinio

237
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,080
tree he confessed to omitting words he

238
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
couldn't explain because he didn't

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,560
understand them in a manner which would

240
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,970
enrage and amaze all future

241
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,340
lexicographers he acknowledged that many

242
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,050
terms of art manufacture and trade are

243
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,570
emitted but for this defect I'm a bold

244
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,760
the allege it was unavoidable I could

245
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,410
not visit cabins to learn the minds

246
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,690
language nor take a voyage to perfect my

247
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,090
skill in the dialect of navigation his

248
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,040
dictionaries lacking in the areas of law

249
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,980
medicine and the physical sciences he

250
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,410
left out rude words and went to society

251
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,900
ladies asked him why he responded what

252
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,820
my dears then you've been looking for

253
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,150
them

254
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,160
the dick show is finally published in to

255
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,440
failure volumes in 1755 and this is it

256
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,790
with all his emissions and banishment

257
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,320
sits a wonder that the dictionary

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
carried any weight at all in fact it

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,100
carried immense Authority and also

260
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,440
served a purpose of national prime that

261
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,300
English literature could boast such a

262
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,220
mighty engine of words and through the

263
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,560
genius not of a French committee but of

264
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,170
an English individual we like that and

265
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,390
the personality of that individual

266
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,090
shines through willful prejudiced and

267
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,490
learn it the dictionary becomes an

268
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,160
autobiography a portrait of an age and a

269
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,110
book that remains entertaining way

270
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,690
beyond its useful life as a tool though

271
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,670
it has to be admitted that as a tool it

272
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,440
doesn't stand up by modern standards

273
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,660
some of its etymologies accounts of the

274
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,520
origins of words are questionable and

275
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,630
its definitions don't always shed light

276
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,910
cough a convulsion of the lungs

277
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,910
medicated by some sharp serosa tea and

278
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,240
dross

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,410
he says the recomment or desperation of

280
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,290
metals sometimes they're biased or

281
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,250
inaccurate oops he describes as a grain

282
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,320
which in England is generally given to

283
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,720
horses but in Scotland supports the

286
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,570
not exhilarating not delightful as to

287
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,300
make dictionaries his dull work when he

288
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,010
began his work he sounded very much like

289
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,830
the inheritor of Swift's great plan the

290
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,960
idea here was to make a dictionary by

291
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
which the pronunciation of our language

292
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,160
may be fixed it's used as attained and

293
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,770
its duration lengthen but after he

294
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,420
worked on the dictionary and come to

295
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,400
write the purpose his pragmatism and his

296
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
honesty so a rueful but radical change

297
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,920
of mind English wasn't going to be tied

298
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,740
down no dictionary Johnson added could

299
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,630
embalm a language and preserve it from

300
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,000
corruption and decay implying that for

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,790
Johnson like swift change was still for

302
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,830
the worse but I think there's something

303
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,900
to celebrate in the end of the idea of

304
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,550
trying to fix the meaning of words

305
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,800
English would never be lashed down and

306
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,050
the power of its freedom gave it I think

307
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,300
an extra cylinder when it came up

308
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,680
against the obstacle or the

309
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,140
opposition of other languages

310
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,260
goat a ruminant animal that seems a

311

writer of dictionaries a harmless Drudge

318
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,920
Johnson's work won both brickbats and

319
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,750
Garland's but it was rarely ignored

320
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,880
there was praise from the two European

321
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,779
countries which had established

322
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,760
academies to regulate their language

323
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,250
Italy in France a French Journal

324
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,500
declared that Johnson himself was an

325
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,930
academy for this island and although it

326
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,390
didn't fix forever the meaning or in

327
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,550
Swift in Johnson's word ascertain a

328
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,339
single word the dictionary is still read

329
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,370
and enjoyed in all its eccentric dusty

330
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:01,810
glory the second half of the 18th

331
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,730
century was an age when nature itself

332
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,560
was being put into classical order by

333
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,420
landscape gardeners like William Kent

334

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,279
host of grammarians led by Robert laughs

336
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,589
wanted to do the same to the English

337
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,550
language from now on things were

338
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,290
different from but certainly not

339
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,870
different to the old individual freedoms

340
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,449
in some ways they added clarity in other

341
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,120
ways they created pedantry between you

342
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,250
and I was outlawed between you and me

343
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,070
was now the only way comparatives were

344
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,720
to be used with a pair of objects and

345
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,209
superlatives with more the better of two

346
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,329
but the best of three in comparables

347
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,630
like perfect unique or round weren't to

348
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,670
be qualified so you should no longer be

349
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,820
more unique or less perfect lie and lay

350
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,529
we distinguished from each other as were

351
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,930
will and shall perhaps surprisingly

352
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,420
louth recognize that a preposition was

353
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,209
permissible to end a sentence with

354
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,510
though avoiding it was more elegant but

355
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,550
we're two ways of using language existed

356
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,820
one must be wrong they carved a single

357
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,350
path through the thickets of English

358
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,730
grammar and they began to turn their

359
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,589
attention to the cavalry there were

360
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,569
attempts to ban popular words and

361
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,510
phrases words such as fib banter bigot

362
