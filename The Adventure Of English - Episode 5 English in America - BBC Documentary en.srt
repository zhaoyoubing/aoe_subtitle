1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,529
so far in the adventure of English we've

2
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,240
traced the story of the language through

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
its first thousand years from the 5th

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,529
century to its great flowering at the

5
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,830
time of Shakespeare what began as a

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,320
minor Germanic dialect had come to these

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,899
shores with the Saxons endured invasion

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,930
by Vikings and 300 years of suppression

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,180
by Norman French during which time

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,059
English virtually went underground he

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,680
did even topple the Latin as the

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,450
language of worship and philosophy and

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,550
by the Elizabethan age English

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:55,190
completely dominated this sceptred aisle

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,320
but now the English language is about to

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,600
leave Britain in the next four programs

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,890
will tell the story of the way you

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,080
English became Britain's greatest export

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,060
some would say gift to the modern world

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,570
and how it became a global language

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,850
we shall see how English travelled to

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,190
India where it encountered scores of

23
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,560
other more ancient languages including

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,900
Sanskrit which did much the mother our

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,080
own tongue yet even at the end of our

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,880
imperial rule in the mid twentieth

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,220
century English remains in India as a

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,070
major unifying tongue we'll follow it to

29
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,930
the West Indies where new English

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,330
dialects have been spawned as rich and

31
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,280
vigorous as the native ones used by

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,850
Thomas Hardy and D H Lawrence and to

33
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,790
Australia where once exiled English now

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,250
reaches back to influence the use of the

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,640
mother country but first to the new

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,490
world where 17th century Puritan English

37
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,650
stubbornly beat up opposition from

38
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,200
native tongues and rival European powers

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,600
to become the language of what was to

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,509
grow into the greatest country on Earth

41
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:22,550
America

42
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:45,870
you

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,599
this was the Newfoundland to the first

44
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,430
settlers eyes this was a vast and it

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,159
seemed empty space and yet is because of

46
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,109
their first determined steps onto this

47
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,239
soil nearly four hundred years ago that

48
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:10,170
English would one day speak for America

49
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,390
this is Plymouth Rock it's literally the

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,910
foundation stone of modern America well

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,920
this is the very spot where the Pilgrim

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,810
Fathers landed in New England in

53
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,830
November 16 2010 on the Mayflower there

54
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,840
were religious separatists and they were

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,850
here to create a new community where

56
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,040
they could worship as they wished they

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,810
bound themselves to another the

58
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,750
Mayflower Compact swearing to found a

59
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,730
colony for the glory of God and the

60
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,890
advancement of the Christian faith they

61
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,710
were above all people who lived by the

62
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,010
Word of God in English they came from a

63
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,290
hard-line Puritan religious tradition

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,720
which had been persecuted and reviled

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,850
they'd been tortured and murdered for

66
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,860
their faith in an english-language Bible

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,860
and to them that Bible that language

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,180
meant life itself they weren't the first

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,460
people on the continent Native Americans

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,960
had been here for thirty thousand years

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,450
and the woods and the plains rang with

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,860
the sounds of hundreds of their

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,930
languages when the Pilgrim Fathers

74
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,150
looked around them instead of a New Eden

75
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,640
they saw what they described as a

76
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,220
hideous and desolate wilderness full of

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,900
threat and danger and for the season it

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,520
was winter and they that know the

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,290
winters of that country know them to be

80
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,660
sharp and violent and subject to cruel

81
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,570
and fierce storms dangerous to travel to

82
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,910
known places much more to search an

83
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,610
unknown coast besides what could they

84
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,680
see but a desolate wilderness full of

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,980
wild beasts and wild men and what

86
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,110
multitudes there might be of them they

87
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,080
knew not

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,180
they were cold hungry and pray to

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,640
sickness nearly half of the company of

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,410
144 died that first winter it wasn't

91
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,240
going to be easy to turn their oath into

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,790
reality and to give English its toehold

93
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,090
on the land the Pilgrim Fathers had one

94
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,310
advantage though they had come here to

95
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,280
stay and they wanted their settlement to

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,620
be English New England they were to call

97
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,960
it but true England might have been more

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,600
accurate their first move was to build a

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,760
settlement recreated here Plymouth

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,720
Plantation

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,730
they lived in terror of the supposedly

102
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,850
wild men in the wilderness outside but

103
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,650
before they could even do that they were

104
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,720
to owe their survival to one of those

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,240
wild men and an extraordinary encounter

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,050
with the English language and whilst we

107
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,380
were busy here about we were interrupted

108
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,970
for there presented himself as Savage

109
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,470
which caused an alarm

110
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,470
he very boldly came all alone up to the

111
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,390
houses where we intercepted it not

112
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,880
suffering him to go in as undoubtedly he

113
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,880
would out of his boldness he saluted us

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,830
in English and Bay us welcome

115
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,069
so welcome was the first word spoken by

116
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,360
native that the Pilgrim Fathers

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,090
understood the man who'd come out of the

118
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,800
wilderness had picked up some words from

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,479
the English fishermen who worked the

120
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:13,150
coast even more extraordinary he was

121
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,039
able to introduce them to this quantum

122
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,919
or Squanto as he became known he is the

123
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,319
most important man in this chapter of

124
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,240
the adventure of English he'd been

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,490
kidnapped by English sailors 15 years

126
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,409
before take it to London where he was

127
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,240
trying to be a guide an interpreter and

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,580
learn English then he managed to escape

129
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,970
on a return visit to the colonists it

130
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,069
must have seemed like a miracle he was

131
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,990
the most unlikely of all coincidences

132
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,819
that they should have settled near the

133
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,830
tribal home of the man who was almost

134
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,380
certainly the only English speaker for

135
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,750
hundreds of miles around but for the

136
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,610
extraordinary good fortune the whole

137
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,409
history of America might have been very

138
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,199
different for Squanto saved the colony

139
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,050
and who knows gave America the English

140
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,650
language

141
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,300
Squanto taught the settlers how to farm

142
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,460
the unfamiliar land and he got them

143
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,650
through that terrible first New England

144
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,400
winter it's almost certain that without

145
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,680
him sickness and hunger would have wiped

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,430
out the settlers against all odds the

147
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,409
English colony had been saved by an

148
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:20,229
encounter with the English language the

149
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,300
adventurer had planted its roots in

150
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:31,050
American soil

151
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,880
the settlers had a new country full of

152
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,490
new places and geographical features new

153
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,950
animals and plants they needed words to

154
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,110
describe them and occasionally they

155
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,040
turned to the native languages skunk was

156
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,540
derived from the local language and

157
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,910
squash for the variety of pumpkin grown

158
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,160
here meaning young woman was a

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,770
local word as was Papoose a young child

160
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,470
and wigwam was another early borrowing

161
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,930
from the local languages but what's

162
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,850
really remarkable is not that these

163
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,290
words did enter the English vocabulary

164
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,350
but how few of them there were four

165
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,000
centuries English had been borrowing

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,830
words in their thousands from Latin

167
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,960
Danish French and every other language

168
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,420
it had come into contact with but here

169
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,370
faced with the richness of an entire

170
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,620
continent the English borrowed words not

171
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,320
in thousands but in handfuls the

172
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,120
writings of the founding fathers here

173
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,040
run to thousands of pages but contain

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,610
less than a dozen borrowed Indian words

175
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,330
so why are there so few in a strange new

176
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,070
country the English settlers may have

177
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,750
taken great comfort in making the

178
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,520
objects around them at least sound

179
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,040
familiar look at the names they gave the

180
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,510
local terrain Falmouth Yarmouth

181
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,460
Boston Cambridge Bella Ricki Bedford

182
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,230
Taunton they were trying to recreate the

183
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,040
English shires

184
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,670
in the American wilderness and perhaps

185
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,860
there was desperation here as well as

186
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,440
determination the true language their

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,960
own they would survive as they had in

188
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,510
the old country so they put a wall

189
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,670
between themselves and the native world

190
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,680
in the end we must conclude that they

191
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,540
were here to impose their habits and

192
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,760
their language on the land not to be

193
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,830
changed by it

194
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,490
words God's good English words were at

195
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,050
the heart of the lives of the settlers

196
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,840
here improper speech was a crime

197
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,500
blasphemy slander cursing lying perjury

198
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,380
railing revealing scolding swearing

199
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,210
threatening treason and defying

200
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,150
Authority were all offenses the

201
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,770
colonists were trying to control the

202
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,960
language and this set the pattern for

203
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,600
their teaching of English and as New

204
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,670
England grew this was how they did it

205
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:59,450
with a New England primer

206
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:13,410
the Bible I see from the very beginning

207
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,570
Americans took immense care over the

208
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,040
correct teaching of English

209
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,410
it was taught well and in a way that was

210
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,900
highly religious and this set the tone

211
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,620
as English spread

212
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,300
it wasn't all going English's way though

213
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,550
other European powers are adjusting for

214
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,920
influence in the new world Delaware

215
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,630
where a Swedish settlement had taken

216
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,509
root was conquered in 1655 by the Dutch

217
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,060
Admiral Peter Stuyvesant and

218
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,019
incorporated into the Dutch New

219
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,790
Netherlands his base New Amsterdam

220
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,560
Washington conquered by the British in

221
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,459
1664 and renamed New York there was

222
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,170
rivalry with the French which turned

223
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,980
into war when it finally ended in 1763

224
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,779
Britain was given sell claim to the east

225
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,759
of the continent and took a grip on the

226
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,550
north in Canada even the Spanish colony

227
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,940
of Florida came under British rule but

228
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,800
perhaps the real edge that gave English

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,329
a stronger presence than the other

230
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:13,279
European languages came not through the

231
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,829
gun but through the plow sure the

232
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,569
Spanish on the whole concentrated on

233
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,279
sending armies and priests to the New

234
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,860
World and taking gold the French were

235
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,720
interested in sending fur trappers and

236
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,269
trading with the natives it was only the

237
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,190
English who continued the spirit of the

238
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,790
Pilgrim Fathers and came to stay

239
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,160
persistence and sheer weight of numbers

240
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,509
eventually ensured that English not

241
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:37,730
Spanish Dutch or French would be the

242
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,290
language heard from the Atlantic coast

243
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,329
to the Appalachian Mountains

244
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,180
but his English spread it also started

245
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,189
to develop a character return to drift

246
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,670
away from the language spoken in England

247
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,959
there was already the beginnings of the

248
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,569
tomato tomato problem in some cases

249
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,480
meaning shifted English shop had become

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,660
an American store lumber meant rubbish

251
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,579
in the old country for Americans lumber

252
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,199
was and still is cut timber and Hall

253
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:08,930
came to me to transport in a vehicle not

254
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,459
as in England to move by force American

255
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,990
English was also developing its own

256
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,480
sound the first settlers had come from

257
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,310
various parts of England each with its

258
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,250
own regional accent but no single accent

259
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,410
dominated as they talked to each other

260
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,610
the variety very quickly became a blend

261
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,899
to this day there's only a tiny

262
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,910
variation accents across America

263
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,889
compared to Britain and the further west

264
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,529
you go the more true that becomes by the

265
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,819
middle of the 18th century in the

266
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:39,070
absence of

267
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,080
your pronunciations and dialect words

268
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
has been noted approvingly by upper

269
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,070
class British visitors who regarded all

270
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,340
such variations as vulgar in 1764 Lord

271
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,530
Gordon wrote the propriety of language

272
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,140
here surprised me much the English

273
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,360
tongue being spoken by all ranks in a

274
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,740
degree of purity and perfection

275
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,170
surpassing any but the polite part of

276
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,180
London it's a sentiment that would be

277
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,190
repeated again and again that the

278
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,320
Americans didn't just be good English

279
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,270
they spoke it better than the English

280
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:16,000
themselves it wasn't only where language

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,530
was concerned that the colonists began

282
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,570
to stand up to the English tension was

283
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,940
growing between them and the crown in

284
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,060
1775 here on this bridge at Concord in

285
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,940
Massachusetts 75 American volunteers

286
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,620
confronted 700 for his troops one of

287
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,390
them fired Weathers ever since been

288
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,250
called with a touch of hyperbole the

289
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,980
shot heard round the world revolution

290
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,620
had begun a year later 13 colonies

291
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,330
declared their independence and did so

292
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,430
imperfect what we might call classical

293
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,020
English we hold these truths to be

294
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,060
self-evident that all men are created

295
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,460
equal that they are endowed by their

296
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,590
creator with certain unalienable rights

297
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,650
that among these are life liberty

298
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,570
pursuit of happiness John Adams who had

299
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,040
become the second President of the

300
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,320
United States rate of a future in which

301
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,630
all Americans spoke the language equally

302
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,520
well in which eloquence would be the way

303
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,080
to high office and no one will be

304
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
excluded because their speech betrayed

305
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,610
inferior origins it was a birth of a

306
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,010
democratic ideal that still part of the

307
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,990
American myth that anyone can become

308
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,030
present everyone would have a

309
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,610
presidential recovery and accent this

310
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,020
was no longer the King's English

311
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,910
but perhaps the people's English and

312
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,390
they wanted to set it in stone this is

313
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,940
another foundation of America not a rock

314
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,420
but a little blue book it was written by

315
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,400
a schoolteacher called Noah Webster

316
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,080
through the last years of the 18th

317
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,120
century in the 19th century it was sold

318
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
in countless general stores like this

319
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,780
one stacked among the tins of molasses

320
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,700
and sacks of beans the snake' oils

321
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,860
paraffin lamps and shovels it soon

322
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,790
became known

323
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,800
the American spelling book or the

324
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,260
blue-backed speller it sold at fourteen

325
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,150
cents a copy and in its first hundred

326
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,030
years it sold 60 million copies more

327
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,860
than any other book in American history

328
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,320
with the exception of the Bible this is

329
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,480
one of the most influential books in the

330
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,680
history of English the first word is

331
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,870
academic the first sound is a C perfect

332
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:28,710
the next part is aa aa d e M then I see

333
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:37,480
altogether Democratic d e M the hundreds

334
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,130
of words and model sentences in

335
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,450
Webster's book have been repeated by

336
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,070
millions of children on countless

337
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,710
occasions all together very nice and the

338
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,540
practices thought have changed the sound

339
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,180
of the language to this day Americans

340
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,040
tend to pronounce words with a farm or

341
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,290
even emphasis than the English and in

342
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,330
particular than the clipped vowels of

343
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,280
the English aristocracy whose influence

344
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,860
Webster wanted to oppose where the

345
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,320
English say Cemetery the Americans have

346
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,770
cemetery English laboratory American

347
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,010
laboratory but pronunciation wasn't all

348
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,080
that he influenced it was from this book

349
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,630
that American learn how to spell correct

350
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,610
spelling came to be seen as a standard

351
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,410
of education and civilization throughout

352
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,020
America and it still is today and the

353
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,090
spelling bee became part of the life of

354
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,160
every town and village this morning

355
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,440
we're gonna start a spelling lesson with

356
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,910
practice for the spelling bee that we're

357
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,670
going to be doing the first word is

358
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,930
syllable sometimes when you study words

359
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,670
you might break them into a syllable

360
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,680
pattern Webster's book standardized

361
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,510
spelling across America and he also

362
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,430
tried to improve on inconsistent and

363
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,420
illogical Spelling's the next word is

364
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,250
democracy yeah

365
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:59,020
tem o c ry under Webster's system honor

366
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,660
color and a score of similar words lost

367
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,850
day you double letters were reduced to

368
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,949
single ones like the airline traveler or

369
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,970
the G in Wagga er replaced our e as the

370
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,970
ending of theater or Center defense with

371
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,699
the sea became defense with an S acts

372
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:29,680
lost its e acts England had made the

373
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,960
language but America had begun to claim

374
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,840
its future by the 1820s East Coast

375
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,340
America was presenting itself

376
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,440
confidently as the guardian of English

377
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,290
meeting up vulgarity and fashion there

378
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,820
is even a cheeky motion proposed in the

379
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,320
House of Representatives to invite the

380
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,330
sons of the English aristocracy to come

381
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,010
to America to learn how to speak

382
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,560
properly Americans felt they kept the

383
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,140
English language pure for 200 years so

384
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,030
pure that they were still using words in

385
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,320
English had dropped words like a

386
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
greenhorn burly deft scant talented and

387
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,830
likely Americans still say sick to mean

388
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,080
ill not just nauseous they say for

389
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,090
meaning autumn just as the English did

390
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,820
once and when Americans say I guess

391
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,740
they're using a formal word that would

392
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,980
have been familiar to Chaucer yes and

393
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,480
they denied that they were changing the

394
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,220
language when Webster published his

395
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,930
groundbreaking American Dictionary in

396
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,950
1828 he claimed that is this contained

397
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,290
less than fifty terms that were new to

398
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,880
the country here was America claiming to

399
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,010
preserve English in all its past glories

400
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,410
to have erected a barrier against change

401
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,990
and corruption but they could no more

402
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,000
exclude these natural developments in

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,980
the language than the first colonists

404
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,170
could hide behind a stockade from the

405
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,650
world beyond John Adams had predicted

406
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,390
that America would drive the English

407
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,000
language into a great future his vision

408
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,060
was prophetic but the language would be

409
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,130
very different from the measured East

410
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,110
Coast tones that Adamson had known

411
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,310
American English was going west

412
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:28,800
and going wild

413
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,500
in 1804 the United States purchased what

414
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,120
was then called Louisiana from the

415
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,550
French for three cents an acre and more

416
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,140
than doubled the size of the country

417
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,980
overnight

418
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,990
you

419
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,730
and these lands were nothing less than

420
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,980
the whole american heartland the Great

421
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,960
Plains and prairies drained by the

422
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,610
Mississippi River and it's tributaries

423
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,059
like the Missouri Ohio and Tennessee it

424
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,380
stretched all the way from New Orleans

425
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,539
in the south to the Rocky Mountains and

426
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,970
what is today the Canadian border in the

427
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,970
north

428
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,900
Jefferson the president sent an

429
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,850
expedition of 45 men under the

430
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,590
leadership of captains Meriwether Lewis

431
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,690
and William Clark into the unknown

432
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,150
interior in search of a navigable river

433
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:26,909
route to the west coast

434
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,830
Lewis and Clark's expedition became one

435
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,570
of the epic journeys in the history of

436
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,330
exploration it started here in st. Louis

437
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,980
on the great junction where the

438
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,899
Mississippi and the Missouri rivers come

439
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:40,299
together Lewis and Clark were army

440
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,039
trained frontiersman backwoods

441
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,690
specialists and because Jefferson

442
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,240
insisted on daily journals being kept

443
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,850
the expedition was recorded not in a

444
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,889
Puritan language of faith nor in

445
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,200
Webster's urbane prose but in the

446
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,269
practical language of the frontier and

447
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,549
this is crucial because it marks the

448
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,470
beginning not only the opening of the

449
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,539
continent but of the decline of the East

450
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:09,220
Coast grip on American English we

451
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,080
finished butchering the Buffalo and on

452
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,999
my return to camp I plot within a few

453
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:15,220
inches of a rattlesnake but fortunately

454
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,769
escaped his bite we also pass another

455
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:20,019
Creek and a very bad rapid which reached

456
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,220
quite across the river

457
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,710
a female elk and its fawn swum down

458
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,389
through the waves which ran very high

459
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,730
hence the name of Elk Rapids which we

460
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,639
instantly gave this place opposite to

461
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,769
these Rapids there is a high bluff and a

462
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,779
little above on the lar bird a small

463
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,610
cottonwood bottom in which we found

464
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,409
sufficient timber for our farce and

465
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,669
encampment these are words peculiar to

466
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,009
America or in a peculiarly American use

467
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,470
in England the creek is a tidal Inlet in

468
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,450
America it's broadened its meaning to

469
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,549
cover all manner of streams adjectives

470
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,860
turning to nouns rapid into Rapids and

471
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,289
Bluff was coined here to describe flat

472
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,539
cliffs rattlesnake was another of those

473
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,100
descriptive combinations of English

474
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,889
words as was Cottonwood and elk is one

475
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,360
of the words imported from England and

476
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,639
applied to a different beast buffalo

477
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,470

478

00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:14,980
book about China Lewis and Clark's

480
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,230
journals include not Webster's 50 words

481
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,929
peculiar to America but over 2,000 of

482
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:22,269
them most are names of objects a great

485
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,249
words like hickory hominy maize moccasin

more obscure words like Kinnikinnick and

this was just the beginning

507
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,149
in the wake of Lewis and Clark the Great

508
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,539
Rivers became America's super highways

509

taking new settlers to the new lands

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,009
this was the hub of the frontier in the

514
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,440
1830s and 40s the very word immigrant is

an American invention vast migrations of

516
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,730
people had never been a huge factor in

517
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,769
the old world but it was the defining

518
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,360
experience of the new one and new

519
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,639
settlers brought new linguistic energies

520
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,769
the Pilgrim Fathers had come primarily

521
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,840
from the south and east of England but

522
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,999
two centuries on Americans were as

523
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,769
likely to come from Scotland escaping

524
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:14,210
the aftermath of the Highland Clearances

525
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,429
or from Ulster often driven out by

famine high rents religious intolerance

527
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,779
or simply looking for the chance to make

528
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,389
a new and better life as many as half

529
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,889
the population of Ulster crossed the

530
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:27,529
Atlantic and many kept moving west they

531
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:29,509
became a major part of the rich mix of

532
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,519
people who were creating a new American

533
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:39,870
country and a new American voice

534
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,210
Scots and Irish brought new words and

535
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,620
expressions to America

536
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,260
the Scottish verbs Scoon meaning to skim

537
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,690
over water took to the sea as a new type

538
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,300
of ship the schooners the Irish donated

539
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,950
to add cabin to name the typical

540
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,290
frontier dwelling they also brought dead

541
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,690
as in dead straight and the similar use

542
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,760
of plumb and right came to America

543
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,559
through use by both Scots and Irish as

544
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,510
did the habit of sticking an a on the

545
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:10,140
front of verbs like a going the old

546
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,640
French process too is apparent

547
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,440
everywhere along the Mississippi it's

private house for a municipal building

559

invention a palace for all the people

far grander in ambition and the Inns and

taverns had offered rest to travelers in

563
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,570
England and their clients were

564
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,000
businessmen in 18th century England

565
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,530
merchants had been described as

566
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,780
businessmen but now the word took on its

567
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,970
modern American meaning the mover and

568
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,100
shaker in the worlds of finance and

569
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:10,710
expansion and opportunity

570
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,750
the country was on the move and on the

571
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,450
make the river teem with poor migrants

572

rednecks have got their name from away

573
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,650
their necks were burnt by the Sun as

574
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,630
they bent to work in the fields because

575
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,340
they couldn't afford the steamboat fur

576
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,440
they traveled on rafts which they

577
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,540
steered with us called rifts so they

578
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,880
were known as the riffraff on board

579
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,770
boats like this one richer travelers

580
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,420
were in turn regarded as highfalutin

581
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,550
because of the high fluted smokestacks

582
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,040
that carried soot and cinders well away

583
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,840
from those passengers and also perhaps

584
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,420
because of this to five hats those dudes

biggest on the boat woman this is

587
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,970
five-card stud gambling was a favorite

588
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,740
activity among the riverboat passengers

589
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,840
passed the buck and the buck stops here

590
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,180
both come from such card games the buck

591
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,550
was a buck horn handled knife passed

592

round to show who was Delia and they're

593
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,420
just the start of the phrases that

594
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,040
American gamblers gave to the language

595
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,730
in the middle of the 19th century

596
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,100
assuming you happen esha deol became

597
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,140
part of phrases like square deal new

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,970
throws in his hand but you keep a poker

607

608
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,490
cards are stacked against you someone

Cheers

612
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,210
gambling and drinking spread across the

613
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,429
West no surprise there this was a very

614
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,260
different frontier from the original one

615
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,450
at Plymouth and nothing added more slang

616
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,490
words and phrases to the language than

617
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,280
alcohol barroom and saloon both entered

618
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,260
the language soon followed by bartender

619
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,780
and set him up measures like a snifter a

620
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,000
 and a finger all came from the

621
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,520
bars of America and bootlegging comes

622
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,990
from the practice of hiding a flat

623
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,559
bottle of whiskey in the leg of a boot

624
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,549
to be sold illegally to the natives and

625
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,990
there were literally hundreds of terms

626
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,850
for drunk even before the Revolution

627
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,040
Benjamin Franklin listed two hundred and

628
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,870
twenty nine of them minted in America

very weary teetotal was another word

642
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,169
that came into the language from the

643
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:08,820
Irish settlers along with speakeasy

644

shillelagh and smithereens yes indeedy

645
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:13,650
and no siree and later of course came on

646
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:22,080
the wagon westward expansion had long

647
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,760
been the cause of land disputes between

648
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,200
the settlers and the natives

649
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,179
and once they left the Great Rivers for

650
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,860
the wagon routes like the Oregon and the

651

Santa Fe trails

652
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,650
contact and often friction between

653
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,059
migrants and Indians increased many of

654
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,620
the Indian words that had already come

655
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,540
into English reflected this antagonism

656
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,850
sculpt a good old English noun had

657
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,919
become a far more threatening verb as

658
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,610
early as 1693 tomahawk was another early

659
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,130
addition to the language so were warpath

word for white man and firewater the

662
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,350
term they gave to alcohol

663
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,420
phrases like no-can-do or long time no

664
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,850
see are literal translations from Indian

665

languages the word grave to describe

666
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,340
Indian warriors were certainly inherited

667
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,710
from the French and buk slang for a

668
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,080
dollar derives from buckskin the

669
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,270
standard unit of trade between Europeans

670
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,880
and Indians conflict with the natives

671
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,650
was just one of the hazards faced by the

672
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,900
people who went west every one of them

673
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,520
had an epic journey to tell of the

674
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,530
hardships imposed by distance and the

675
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,630
weather everyone had carved a new life

676
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,400
out of a landscape made on a scale

677
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,940
unknown in Europe they chose new

678
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,980
American heroes for themselves through

679
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,720
whose stories they could distill their

680
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,030
own experiences and they chose them and

681
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,000
told tales about them on a grand scale

682
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,740
the most famous of all straddled the gap

683
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,570
between fact and fiction Davy Crockett

684
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,160
he was as we know from the song born in

685
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,960
a mountain top in Tennessee he was the

686
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,760
son of a veteran of the revolution he

687
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,560
became a congressman famous for his

688
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,870
plane speaking and he died defending the

689
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,150
Alamo in Texas in 1836 he was as

690
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,950
American as they came and he became a

691
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,320
legend the king of the wild frontier the

692
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,030
hero of a series of paper-bound books

693
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,580
telling exaggerated stories about him

694
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,680
this fictionalized Crockett was the

695
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,330
first great exponent of a style of

696
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,940
speech as big as the country called tall

697
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,250
talk when he opened his mouth he made

698
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,720

724
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:21,950
language was hunky-dory rambunctious

splendiferous its figure whose in speech

726
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,780
and that habit of coming up with vivid

727
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,760
verbal images has left us with many that

728
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,720
figure in everyday talk it's not my

729
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,860
funeral if you fly off the handle

730
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,150
because you have a chip on your shoulder

731
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,340
an axe to grind I might sit on the fence

732
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,210
and dodges issue

733
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,190
I won't fizzle out I will crack up no

734
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,809
two ways about it I'll knuckle down and

735
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:42,710
make the fur fly

736
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,179
I'll go the whole hog and knock the

737
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:45,740
spots out of you and you'll be a goner

738
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,630
you'll kick the bucket so face the music

739
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,309
you're barking up the wrong tree

740
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,049
you won't get the drop on me I'm in

741
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:52,220
cahoots with some people with the

742
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,049
know-how keep a stiff upper lip and have

743
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,190
the horse sense to pull up stakes okay

744
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,840
within two generations of the opening of

745
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,549
Louisiana the American language had been

746
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:04,070
reborn no legislator sitting in a

747
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,690
library in all of the eastern states

748
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,669
could have hoped to arrest its exuberant

749
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,100
progress it's a fact that the biggest

750
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,070
author of the language is unknown this

751
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,870
was the Democratic language that Adams

752
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,059
had foreseen but democracy meant that

753
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:18,679
everyone threw in their two cents worth

754
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,169
and the old conservative values were

755
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,120
trampled in the movement West

756
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,880
I never quicker than when gold was

757
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:34,660
discovered in them thar hills

758
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,430
Gold Fever brought tens of thousands of

759
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,990
people from the eastern states and now

760
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,050
let us home were loaded with new words

761
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,700
prospector was one they wrote about how

762
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,010
they staked their claim about how they

763
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,110
hope that gold dust would pan out of the

764
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,060
water that they were sipping while they

765
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,860
would strike it lucky or strike it rich

766
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,590
and brews a bonanza which came from the

767
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,660
Spanish word for fair weather and for

768
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,670
the first time a surefire investment

769
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:05,980
became known colloquially as a gold mine

770
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,870
and the gold rush gave us two words that

771
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,640
became far more famous in the 20th

772
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,010
century when a certain levi-strauss

773
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,720
started to make hard wearing clothes for

774
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,850
miners use the cloth called jean

775
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,580
Faustian originally made in Genoa Levi's

776
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,800
and jeans have been as American as Stars

777
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,110
and Stripes ever since the arrival of

778
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,270
the railroad was what really opened up

779
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,010
the country and it created the industry

780
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,929
that gave the West its most

781
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,120
characteristic vocabulary it was a

782
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,640
certain Joseph McCoy who had the idea of

783
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,440
driving cattle often hundreds of miles

784
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,370
to railheads

785
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,500
so they could be exported to the markets

786
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,450
back east previously they'd only been

787
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,340
butchered for local use overnight

788
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,919
McCoy became immensely rich so rich the

789
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,230
story goes that other envious souls used

790
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,090
to try to pass themselves off as the man

791
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,370
who had such a simple but brilliant idea

792
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,290
and so he developed the habit of

793
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,450
introducing himself to strangers as the

794
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,910
real McCoy he gave the world a

795
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,920
catchphrase and he also gave it the

796
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,290
cowboy

797
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,790
English had known the word cowboy since

798
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,980
the 18th century but now it took on a

799
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,660
new currency in a new meaning

800
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,030
McCoy's brainwave turned the cattle

801
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,859
industry into a license to print money

802
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,510
and the cowboy into a national icon

803
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,410
Cowboys had been working near the

804
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,540
Mexican border for years picking up

805
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,859
Spanish words which now drove north with

806
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:32,570
ranch comes from the Spanish as does

807
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,430
Corral where horses or cattle were

808
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,310
penned Mustang Bronco and the more

809
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,119
humble burro

810
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,940
the chaps sombrero and Pancho they might

811
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,339
were the cinch that secured the saddle

812
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:45,890
valerian and the lassoo they used to

813
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,380
rope cattle the Sierras measures and

814
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,390
canyons they rode across the cries of

815
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,700
vamoose and pronto the Stampede that

816
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,710
they feared and the rodeo where they

817
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,050
drove the cattle together all came from

818
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,670
Spanish the language of the West has

819
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,380
become the standard idea of what

820
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,510
American English is like completely

821
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,220
overtaking the proper speech of the East

822
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,900
and the man who is virtually

823
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,089
single-handedly responsible for this was

824
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:13,069
one of the greatest showman and boosters

825
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:13,640
of them all

826
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,550
he was William F Cody Buffalo Bill and

827
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,319
he chose to be buried here on the hill

828
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,210
was above Denver where the Rockies rise

829
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,690
steeply out of the Great Plains

830
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,339
he turned the frontier experience into

831
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,290
an epic entertainment Buffalo Bill's

832
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,380
Wild West extravaganza featured live elk

833
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,450
and Buffalo real Indians attacking a

834
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,200
stagecoach

835
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,480
sharp shooting displays musical cowboys

836
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,400
in spotless outfits that have never seen

837
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,680
a cattle drive and the reenactment of

838
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,599
Custer's last stand at Little Bighorn

839
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,849
in which Buffalo Bill himself arrived on

840
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:48,509
the scene just too late to save the day

841
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:51,279
it was nonsense and it was a smash

842
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,709
across America and Europe for 30 years

843
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:55,929
long after Indian resistance had ended

844
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,669
and the last buffalo herd had been

845
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:58,329
massacred

846
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,429
he created a vote for the language of

847
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,499
the worst and began a line of Western

848
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:04,209
myth that kept that language alive

849
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:06,309
through countless books and films and

850
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:09,069
the dreams of luxury and optimism became

851
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:11,109
an enduring fantasy of a Western

852
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,630
Eldorado and Eden somewhere over the

853
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,579
rainbow or at least the next county line

854
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,769
it's all there in a little song about

855
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,229
the hobos another good frontier word who

856
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:21,999
rode the railways west in search of

857
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,390
their own American dream

858
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,969
in the big rock candy mountains you

859
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:30,849
never change your socks and the little

860
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,459
stream the mouthal how much we cling

861
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,819
down the rocks the brakeman have to tip

862
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,949
their hats and the railroad bulls are

863
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:41,529
blind there's a lake of stew and a

864
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,779
whiskey too you can paddle over on him

865
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,869
in a big canoe in the big rock candy

866
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,459
mountains but there was another group of

867
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,169
Americans who'd never been invited to

868
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:52,029
show that dream the black slave

869
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,279
population of the south and they spoke

870
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:56,140
about their experiences in a very

871
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,909
different language I'll see you all is

872
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:02,819
coming fall in the big rock candy

873
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:10,900
mountain

874
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,820
this is Sullivan's Island a little patch

875
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,710
of land in Charleston Harbor off the

876
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,080
coast of South Carolina it was the first

877
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,700
taste of America for hundreds of

878
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
thousands of immigrants in the 18th and

879
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,660
19th centuries but the immigrants who

880
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,640
came through here hadn't chosen the

881
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,370
American dream of a better life they had

882
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,580
been sold into slavery Sullivan's Island

883
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,670
was a holding pen for imported slaves

884
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,870
between half and two-thirds of them

885
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,240
entered America here before being sold

886
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,710
on mainly to work on the cotton

887
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,400
plantations

888
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,920
there's no Statue of Liberty here just

889
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,530
this plaque erected in 1999 to

890
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,900
commemorate their arrival they came here

891
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,460
from the countries of West Africa and

892
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,160
from plantations in the Caribbean slaves

893
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,990
who spoke different languages were put

894
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,910
together on the same sea voyage here to

895
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,620
stop them plotting together to seize

896
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,490
control of the ship

897
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,980
so one ship and on shore there was a

898
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,480
great fable of languages

899
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,670
the slaves had to find a tongue in which

900
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,320
to talk to one another and to their

901
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,230
masters it was English but English very

902
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,270
heavily influenced by African ways of

903
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,850
talking then y'all get home and put it

904

00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,420
these people are talking is Gullah which

912
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,310
is survived as a distinct variety of

913
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,560
English here around the South Carolina

914
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,500
islands so fella come yeah and walk up

915

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,890
that Bank there either don't you know

917
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,720
that was taught by many people to be the

918
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,820
closest we can get to the kind of

919
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,320
language that would have been spoken by

920
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,330
the slaves in the 18th and early 19th

921
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,780
centuries and that this is the origin of

922
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,690
modern afro-american vernacular did

923
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,610
y'all get off about 50 feet off and

924
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,050
y'all look over there yeah

925
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,000

help

928
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,230
don't die rustling yeah we put

929
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,630
together varying African words along

930
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,610
with Elizabethan English and came out

931
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,020
with something that sound like a dish

932
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,400
yeah well neither yet agree to talk like

933
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,950
this so sometimes people think maybe

934
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,309
it's English then they go but not quite

935
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,619
there were Evo's Mandinka smile Incas

936
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,099
Yorubas Gulas kid see a freak Mende that

937
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,109
were all kidnapped captured and then

938
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:32,359
isolated together on these islands

939
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,630
during enslavement once the slaves

940
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,279
reached the plantations they lived in

941
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,140
cabins like these beside the main house

942
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,910
here are many words that came into

943
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,589
Gullah from African languages have found

944
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,029
their way into standard English words

945
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:46,430
such as banana which comes from a Wolof

946
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,619
language spoken in Senegal and voodoo

947
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,989
traceable to an African word spinach in

948
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,609
the language spoken by the Yoruba people

949
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,130
other African words regimented standard

950
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,019
English include the animals zebra

951
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,359
gorilla and chimpanzee the musical terms

952
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,019
Samba Mambo banjo and Pongo and the food

953
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,599
and plant names goober me peanut yam and

954
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,689
gumbo meaning okra African compound

955
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,279
words were translated giving English

956
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,859
terms like bad Mouse and nitty gritty

957
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,499
originated as a term for the grit that

958
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:19,029
accumulated in the bilges of slave ships

959
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:22,219
as well as McAlary Gullah employ some

960
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,749
grammatical features that differ from

961
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:27,709
standard English if someone say hundred

962
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:29,539
wine for do that I'd be done to him

963
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:32,989
oh yeah so they ask you are you going to

964
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:35,420
do it I already did it and I did it a

965
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,249
long time ago

966
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:38,479
essentially is what you're saying I had

967
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,969
done to him I done don't do this you see

968
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,769
so you hear somebody say I done don't do

969
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,359
that that mean they did it and they did

970
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:46,489
a long time ago and why are you asking

971
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,979
me or getting basically so it's a lot

972
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:51,920
more going into it so if someone says

973
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,869
100 want over the hunter done yet they

974
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:55,549
say you're going over there I had done

975
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:58,160
Yeti that but it don't do that too but I

976
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,630
didn't grind it but they ain't been did

977
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,729
it why don't I ever did it well either

978
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:04,069
did they want to imitate it you see so

979
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,449
it's like well you were going over there

980
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,160
yeah I already went there but when I

981
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,219
went you weren't there but I was there

982
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:12,140
but you're right I wasn't there when you

983
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,900
were there phrases like these have a

984
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,059
rich and economical expressiveness in

985
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,739
other ways Gullah and other black

986
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,479
English's have stripped down their

987
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,759
grammar they drop verbs like is use

988
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:24,739
don't wear Stalin English says doesn't

989
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,779
and omit the apostrophe and s that

990
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,489
standard English uses as a sign of

991
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,890
ownership this kind of simplification is

992
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,019
common when languages meet and emerges

993
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:35,059
of new hybrid it's exactly what happened

994
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,410
when saxs and day

995
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,030
dealt with each other in England in the

996
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,890
9th century and changing this grammar

997
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,590
forever but in this case the changes

998
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,480
were mistakenly taken by many white

999
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,280
observers as evidence that black

1000
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,630
speakers just hadn't got the

1001
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,740
intelligence to speak the language

1002
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,900
properly but they were simply trying and

1003
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,820
failing to copy white speech in fact

1004
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,090
they were adding to the language now

1005
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,980
listen yeah you know some people say a

1006
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,750
dear friend of him but they're always

1007
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,880
your friend like that boy Robert that

1008
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,980
boy no hand nothing to him you yell I

1009
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,230
said that cutter was slow motion and

1010
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,850
that bird rabbit just a Snickers in

1011
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,000
water beat I captain black speakers had

1012
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,830
their own tradition of performances that

1013
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,900
showed just how flexible and Express if

1014
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,940
their language was they told stories and

1015
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,530
they're still told today now hope at all

1016
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,420
I tell you burn rubber hand tick off it

1017
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,280
look at his split a severe Robert is a

1018
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,260
direct descendant of animal tricksters

1019
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,080
who teach in African folklore a view to

1020
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,970
tell the truth but cutter he's a yes of

1021
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,410

lighting in your tool in you in or tool

1023
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,060
in your new way but folktales weren't

1024
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,680
the only thing that fueled dreams of

1025
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,690
freedom with English the slaves had

1026
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,310
learned Christianity white society

1027
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,830
thought it would teach obedience the

1028
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,960
Bible became is central to the lives of

1029
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,820
the slaves as it had been to the first

1030
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,920
settlers in New England but the message

1031
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,320
they found in it wasn't a Beatles it was

1032
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,810
liberty once again the Bible in English

1033
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,260
became the book of freedom yeah Jesus

1034
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:11,859
called me a Jesus call

1035
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:23,259
oh

1036
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:46,170
I better get ready Jesus be coming back

1037
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,519
by the first decade of the nineteenth

1038
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,289
century the American states in the north

1039
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:57,910
and abolish slavery when the blacks of

1040
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,039
the South sang steal away or one more

1041
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,599
river to cross or bound for Canaan land

1042
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,789
they were introducing new words and

1043
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:05,319
sounds into the language and they're

1044
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:07,059
also singing not just about the next

1045
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,190
world but about this one about the hope

1046
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,140
of escaping to the north and to freedom

1047
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,960
the chains of slavery were rusting and

1048
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,420
on the 12th of April 1861 in the early

1049
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,099
hours of the morning shots were fired at

1050
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:19,869
Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor just

1051
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:22,029
behind me this was the start of the

1052
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:23,829
American Civil War which the north of

1053
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,720
course was to win four years later

1054
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,420
Confederate forces abandoned Schultz the

1055
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,759
Union army marched in unopposed they

1056
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:37,029
freed the slaves promised in the

1057
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,619
language of their spirituals had come

1058
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:44,230
good for the black people jostle

1059
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:46,329
the American Civil War gave us the

1060
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:51,700
phrase hold the fort and the first

1061
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,440
people to hear anything on the grapevine

1062
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,869
were in the southern states where army

1063
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,730
telegraph lines strong in the trees

1064
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,829
became so knotted that they were said to

1065
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:04,930
look like Greg Fox you got the Lord's

1066
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,650
forgiveness there was plenty of

1067
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,930
resistance to the new order the Ku Klux

1068
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,970
Klan who apparently derived their name

1069
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,829
from the Greek word coup class meaning

1070
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:17,349
circle were formed in the aftermath of

1071
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,839
the war they gave English the word

1072
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,410
bulldozer originally a bulldoze meaning

1073
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:26,230
a dose large enough for a bull it was a

1074
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,030
dose of whipping and it was administered

1075
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:32,319
to black people often fatally words like

1076
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,119
bulldozers are a savage reminder that

1077
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,650
the end of the war didn't bring the end

1078
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,630
of segregation and Prejudice in theory

1079
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,700
blacks in their language were now free

1080
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,890
to mix with whites but in practice it

1081
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,720
was only the 20th century that the

1082
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,760
mixing of the cabarets really began that

1083
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,130
just like in the plantation houses white

1084
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,319
speakers started to ape black speech and

1085
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,569
cool was born and that's a story for

1086
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:56,170
later program

1087
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,480
even after the Civil War very few white

1088
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,280
people treated black language with any

1089
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,740
interest or respect Warren who did was a

1090
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,360
man who'd grown up on the Mississippi

1091
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,430
and was fascinated by all of its talk

1092
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,070
black and white luckily for us he was a

1093
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,340
genius when he made writing his

1094
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,620
profession he chose as his pen name a

1095
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,390
call that he'd heard the river Bergman

1096
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,400
used to sound a depth of two thousands

1097
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,290
Mark Twain and the river runs through

1098
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,420
Twain's greatest book The Adventures of

1099
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,140
Huckleberry Finn

1100
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,120
it's set in the years before the Civil

1101
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,010
War and to the story of a young boy who

1102
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,290
escapes what he disdainfully calls the

1103
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,270
civilizing influence of his Aunt Sally

1104
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,970
Huck takes to the river on a raft in the

1105
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,670
company of an escaped slave called Jim

1106
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,490
in his introduction Twain told his

1107
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,350
readers that he'd taken great pains to

1108
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,000
capture the different dialects of the

1109
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,880
river a southerner talks music he once

1110
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,040
wrote and when he'd Huck Finn described

1111
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,870
life on the river he found its melody

1112
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,580
it's lovely to live on a raft

1113
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,980
we had the sky up there all speckled

1114
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,620
with stars and we used to lay on our

1115
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,450
backs and look up at them and discuss

1116
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,640
about whether they was made or only just

1117
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,770
happened Jim allowed that they was made

1118
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,500
but I allowed that to happen I judge it

1119
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,450
would have took too long to make so many

1120
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,790
Jim said the moon could have laid him

1121
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,070
well that looked kind of reasonable so I

1122
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,020
didn't say nothing against it because I

1123
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,840
seen a frog lay most as many we used to

1124
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,270
watch the stars that failed to see him

1125
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,270
streak down Jim allowed that got spoiled

1126
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,830
and was Hove out of a nest this is a new

1127
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,110
voice in the American record that of the

1128
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,660
common man under frontier English has

1129
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,400
come a long way from the sober and

1130
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,260
sacred language that the Puritans at

1131
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,300
first brought to New England it has

1132
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,550
changed its sound and it has changed its

1133
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,950
character words were no longer solely

1134
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,810
vehicles for God's truth there are also

1135
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,120
words are defended the East Coast wasn't

1136
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,380
yet ready to relinquish its

1137
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,450
self-appointed role as guardian of the

1138
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,210
language like here at Concord the cradle

1139
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,980
of the revolution the civilized and

1140
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,630
Salas who sat on the library committee

1141
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,940
banned Huckle Griffin for its vernacular

1142
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,270
language it was they said couch

1143
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,940
rough ignorant dialect and that there

1144
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,980
was a systematic use of bad grammar and

1145
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,330
an employment of in elegant expressions

1146
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,620
but though the library committee might

1147
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,840
call Twain's language vulgar it couldn't

1148
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,670
ban the vigor of English that had grown

1149
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,950
up away from the East Coast American

1150
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,620
English Huck's closing words defied

1151
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,680
their attempts to control it there ain't

1152
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,780
nothing more to write about and I am

1153
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,750
rotten glad of it because if I'd have

1154
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,550
known what a trouble it was to make a

1155
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,470
book I wouldn't have tackled it and

1156
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,010
ain't a-going to know more but I reckon

1157
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,990
I got a lot out for the territory ahead

1158
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,930
of the rest because Aunt Sally she's

1159
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,840
gonna adopt me and sivilize me and I

1160
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,720
can't stand it I've been there before

1161
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:05,490
and the vigor continued to increase in

1162
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:10,650
the late 19th century new waves of

1163
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,840
immigrants flooded into America Germans

1164
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,780
Italians Greeks Russians Jews for all

1165
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,850
across Europe they came to a land that

1166
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,100
promised to give a new home to the tired

1167
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,980
poor huddled masses longing to breathe

1168
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,590
free to become American was their dream

1169
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,080
and for most all of them that meant that

1170
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,880
they wanted their children to speak the

1171
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,280
language of the new country they would

1172
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,290
power the adventure of English into the

1173
00:50:34,290 --> 00:51:21,710
20th century

1174
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:26,799
you

1175
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:28,859
you
