00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,140
this is the south bank in London

2
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,000
two thousand years ago if you had heard

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,668
a human voice around here the language

4
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,780
would have been incomprehensible a

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,969
thousand years ago the English language

6
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,899
had established its first base camp

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,170
today English circles the globe it

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,730
inhabits the air we breathe

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,040
what started as a guttural tribal

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,229
dialect seemingly isolated in a small

11
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,839
island is now the language of well over

12
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,970
a thousand million people around the

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,180
world

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,659
you

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,799
you

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,810
the story of the English language is an

17
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,700
extraordinary one it has the

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,340
characteristics of a bold and successful

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,300
adventure tenacity luck near extinction

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,650
on more than one occasion

21
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,840
dazzling flexibility and an

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,360
extraordinary power to absorb and it's

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,410
still going on

24
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,650
new dialects new English's are evolving

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,510
all the time all over the world

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,820
successive invasions introduced then

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,150
threatened to destroy our language our

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,070
first program tells that story

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,510
for 300 years English was forced

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,210
underground our second program tells how

31
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,650
it survived and how it fought back

32
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,310
our third program will tell how the

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,960
English language took on the power

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,100
blocks of church and state

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,690
1/4 how it became the language of

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,960
Shakespeare in later programs were going

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,570
to leave these shores as English did to

38
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,820
tell the story of how in America the

39
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,130
language of one great Empire became that

40
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,100
of another we'll go to the Caribbean

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,650
where a variety of new part English

42
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,150
dialects took root India where English

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,430
became a commanding unifying language in

44
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,020
a country of a thousand tons and

45
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,850
Australia where a confident new English

46
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,890
was invented by a people many of whom

47
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,690
had been expelled from their mother

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,930
country

49
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,459
we'll travel through time to to explore

50
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,739
how English in the 21st century has

51
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,450
become the International language of

52
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,280
business the language in which the

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,989
world's citizens communicate

54
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,500
over the last 15 hundred years these

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,690
small islands have achieved much that is

56
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,290
remarkable but in my view England's

57
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,720
greatest success story of all is the

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,440
English language these programs are

59
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,269
about the words we think in talking

60
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,080
right in singing the words that describe

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:49,319
the life we live this is where we can

62
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,170
begin just after dawn in a foreign

63
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,690
country on a flat shore by the North Sea

64
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,870
in what we now call the Netherlands

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,239
this is Friesland and it's in this part

66
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,670
of the world that we can still hear the

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,890
modern language that we believe sounds

68
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,170
closest to what the ancestor of English

69
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,040
sounded like fifteen hundred years ago

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,390
and this is the mouth of heaven to show

71
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,370
her mouth have a thoughtful an

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,399

yoga doc that for all on the groom in

74
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,080
Friesland many people start their day

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
listening to the weather forecast from

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,250
popular weatherman Pete policeman and

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,680

Vera dial some of his words might sound

79
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,960
familiar like three and four frost and

85
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,020
the loft the reason we can recognize

86
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,090
these words is that modern Frisian and

87
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,490
modern English can both be traced back

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,100
to the same family the Germanic family

89
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,260
of languages and some words have stayed

90
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,910
more or less the same down the centuries

these words were a warlike adventurous

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,419
people they'd been on the move through

96
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,159
Europe for the best part of a thousand

97
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,050
years and now had settlements in what we

98
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,879
would call the lowlands of northern

99
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,819
Europe Holland Germany and Denmark but

100
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,159

a Germanic tribe part of the family that

shores more than 500 years before the

118
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,139
Romans had also come by sea to impose

119
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,930
their will now their empire had crumbled

120
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,910
and they'd abandoned these islands

of them in England but there were a

132
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,410
broken people the clue to their fate

133
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,139
lies in the word the Germanic tribe used

134
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,930
to describe them it was Willis a name

135
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,370
that lives on in our modern languages

136
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,650
Welsh 1,500 years ago

137
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,039
it meant both foreigner and slave the

138
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,930
Celts became servants and followers

139
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,849
second-class citizens the only way up

140
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,919
was to become part of the invaders

141
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,159
tribes to adopt their culture and their

142
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,449
language the Celts in their language

143
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,560
were pushed to the margins

144
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,509
only a handful of words from the Celtic

145
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,100
languages survived into modern English

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,240
in the North where I come from we have

crag meaning Rock Combe meaning deep

148
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,530
valley and dialect words like brat and

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,490
brach for badger

150
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:13,219
there are traces in place-names the tour

Carlisle means a fortified place in the

south they left us the names of Tamils

and Aven Dover and London but these were

157
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,409
fragments the language that prevailed

158
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:46,819
was that of the victors by the end of

159
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,980
the sixth century these Germanic tribes

160
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,029
occupied half of mainland Britain they

161
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,860
had divided into a number of kingdoms

162
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,389
Kent Sussex Essex and Wessex denoting

163
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,490

name Mercer in the Midlands Northumbria

167
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,459
in the north throughout these areas many

168
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,379
modern place names come from that

169
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,779
settlement or use the words they brought

170
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,209
we live with them we live in them every

day

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,419

Tottenham supporters

178
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,500
the Germanic tribes now settled around

179
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,630
the country all spoke their own dialects

180
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,250
from among them when you merge one

181
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,070
language anglo-saxon or Old English and

182
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,279

none of them can really finish Armstrong

184
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,940
even so hard

185
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,960
I just need some youth from their

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,510
teammates really examine a language you

187
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,730
use today and you'll still find hundreds

188
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,680
of words from a language over fifteen

189
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,750
hundred years old

190
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,220
keywords ready from the names we give

191
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,720
family members to numbers think will win

193
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,390

something to eat first going to the

203
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,779
ground

204
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,029
saving the atmosphere much to go there

205
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,650
has been a few high scoring games over

206
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,240
the years then the highest B of a beat

207
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,760
than the sixth one repeat today one guy

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,700
miss most of those words were from Old

209
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,120
English nouns like youth son daughter

210
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,110
field friend home and ground

211
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,870
prepositions like in and on into by and

212
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,320
from and and the are from Old English

213
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,110
all the numbers and verbs like drink

214
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,540
come and go sing like and love but would

215
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,010
these words have sounded different all

216
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,080
those years ago in a slightly quieter

217
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,960
pub I asked language expert quesillo

218
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,030
they sound a little different I mean the

219
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,490
old English the Sun is soo new that's

220
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,660
not so very different game is Garmin

221
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,630
ground is groomed and and I noticed that

222
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,550
Steve says his his daughter loves

223
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,070
singing songs she said that an old

224
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,980
English it would be his doctor lover the

225
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,380
sanga's singing and you can see that

226
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,089
that sounds pretty much like modern

227
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,980
English so in fact you can have a good

228
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,750
conversation in Old English oh yes you

229
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,089
can indeed I mean each each word I'm

230
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,089
saying now is from Old English over any

231
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,699
estimate how many words there

232
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,410
swirling around compared with how many

233
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,449
words we have now we think it was in the

234
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,239
region of 25,000 words I've compared up

235
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,739
with an average destiny which maybe

236
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,419
contains only like hundred thousand

237
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,850
words it sounds pretty small but if you

238
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,619
think about the fact that an average ly

239
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,269
educated person will probably have about

240
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,100
10,000 words and an active recovery

241
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,019
there are plenty of words to go round

242
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,739
English took its first steps away from

243
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,329
its tribal roots with the revival of

244
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,220
Christianity new Michelin hariom he

work of the glorious father who created

in 597 the monk and Pryor Augustine led

a mission from Rome to Kent around the

254
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,659
same time Irish monks of the Celtic

255
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,249
Church were establishing a presence in

256
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,379
the north within a century Christians

257
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,059
built churches and monasteries

258
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,269
this isn't Paul's injera parts of which

259
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:57,199
date from the 7th century faith and

260
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,329
stone weren't the only things the

261
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,649
Christian missionaries brought to the

262
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,719
country they brought the international

263
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,999
language of the Christian religion Latin

264
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,879
Latin terms became part of the English

265
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,399
word horde Altera became altar a

266
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,369
possible us became apostle mass monk and

267
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,139
verse and many others all come from the

268
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,449
Latin this would become a pattern of

269
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,089
English the layering of words taken from

270
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,189
different source languages and from

271
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:26,799
Latin to the English took their script

272
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:32,899
the Angles Saxons frisians and Jutes who

273
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,759
had become the English hadn't brought

274
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,099
script as we know it with them but runes

275
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,740
the runic alphabet was made up of

276
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,839
symbols formed mainly of straight lines

277
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,970
so the letters could be carved into

278
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,600
stone or wood those were their media

279
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,190
rather than parchment or paper though

280
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,680
this is a short poem most examples of

281
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,360
runic writing that survived suggest

282
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,070
runes were mainly used for short

283
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:21,760
practical messages or graffiti the Latin

284
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
alphabet was different with its curves

285
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,110
and bows it allowed words to be easily

286
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,300
written using pen and ink on two pages

287
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,850
of parchment or vellum which gathered

288
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,680
together into a book could be widely

289
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,070
circulated

290
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,809
Christianity brought the book to these

291
00:15:50,809 --> 00:16:05,839
shores verbum the word soon a native

292
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,790
culture of scholarship began to flower a

293
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,009
culture based on Latin and in writing

294
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,600
the Magnificent Lindisfarne Gospels were

295
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,730
created in the 8th century on the island

296
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,709
of Lindisfarne just off the northeast

297
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:26,929

people he wrote of course in Latin the

303

language of scholarship the prevailing

304
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,629
language among the people was still old

305
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:50,449
English but Latin this powerful medium

306
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,660
was now amongst them now old English was

307
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,790
written down using the Latin alphabet

308
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,339
while retaining some of the old runes as

309
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,860
letters from the 7th century we find

310
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,259
English itself written on parchment in a

311
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,299
language and a script which was just

312
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,159
about recognized as our own

march on other languages spoken in

321
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,190
Europe at the time prayers were recorded

322
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,380
and books of the Bible translated the

323
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,180
laws of the land were written down and

324
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,400
the language soon became capable of

325
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,560
recording and expressing an increasingly

326
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,540
wide and subtle range of human

327
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,040
experience and in the right hands Old

328
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,140
English was now powerful and supple

329
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,150
enough to take you to imaginary worlds

those princes heroic campaigns

336
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,490
no one knows who composed the epic

337
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,500
Beowulf sometime between the mid 7th and

338
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,630
end of the 10th century it's the first

339
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,880
great poem in the English language the

340
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,649
beginning of a glorious tradition which

341
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,659
will lead to Chaucer Shakespeare and

Beyond the poem celebrates the glory

346
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,250
be heard in this passage which

367
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,330
that time Seamus what sort of language

368
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,919
was it when you came to do you think

369
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,480
this is a fully developed poetic

370
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,820
language it's certainly fully developed

371
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,730
poetic language it's it's furrier is

372
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,539
capable of great elaboration but what

373
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:16,100
struck me generally about Old English

374
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,539
from the moment I read the bits of the

375
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:19,159
anglo-saxon Chronicle right through to

376
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,889
Beowulf is it's terrific for telling

377
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,679
what happened it's a wonderful sense of

378
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,929
the indicative Moodle through it it's

379
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:29,179
terrific for action terrific for

380
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,750
description

381
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,300
there's a wonderful forthright capacity

382
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,880
to make up extra language in anglo-saxon

383
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,260
the words are very clear and direct bone

384
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,690
and house for example bone house there

385
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,730
you have the house for the body a word

386
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,280
for the body beautiful words for

387
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,630
instruments the harp is called glial BAM

388
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,480
the Glee beam the happy the happy wood

389
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,940
or else the joy would in some cumin wudu

390
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,790
swords or shield the shield is the war

391
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:22,040
board weak board that is a specific

392
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,380
poetic energy that's in the language the

393
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,600
the ability to make compounds which is

394
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,880
still in German I guess that gives us a

395
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,860
great beauty high excessive is the

396
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,370
vocabulary I think there 40,000 words

397
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,190
recorded in in Beowulf but a lot of the

398
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,610
words repeat themselves in probably this

399
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,280
is in poetry more than in the prose if

400
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,180
we heard an anglo-saxon speaker speaking

401
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,000
under his roof to his companion

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,190
we'd probably hear very a quicker a

403
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,650
different less elaborate language from

404
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,570
Beowulf would you say was it is very

405
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,880
clearly written to be read aloud it's

406
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,180
certainly written to be read aloud the

407
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,220
question that that agitates some

408
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,290
scholars as whether it was written you

409
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,460
know but I think the general consensus

410
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,110
now is that by the time you get to bail

411
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,680
of you have a writer dealing with a

412
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,550
traditional oral language what we

413
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,680
Gardiner NER dawam

414
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,060

who'sa are filling us Ellen from a dog

416
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,420
certainly you open the book what way

gardenia and year document asks to be

418
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,710
uttered and there are many speeches in

419
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,800
it and it comes off the tongue with with

420
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,670
terrific directness

421
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,940
Latin and Greek had created great bodies

422
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,100
of literature in the classical past in

423
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,040
East Arabic and Chinese were being used

424
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,240
in the eighth and ninth centuries

425
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,330
languages of poetry but at that time no

426
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,550
other language in the Christian world

427
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,800
could match the achievement of the bear

428
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,200
Wolford and his anonymous contemporaries

429
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,140
Old English was flourishing the

430
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,900
adventure was underway but while the

431
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,700
seeds of English had come from these

432
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,310
frisian shores in the fifth century so

433
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,410
now in the late eighth century a

434
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,840
potential destroyer was repairing his

435
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,780
battle fleet 500 miles or so to the

436
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,990
north

437
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:01,659
in the late 8th century the latin-based

438
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,459
culture of scholarship which had grown

439
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,709
up in places like Lindisfarne and which

440
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,389
had also been the cradle of old english

441
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:12,209
faced extinction from across the sea

442
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,740
these ruins are of the medieval

443
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,929
monastery that stood on the island of

444
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:30,870
Lindisfarne it was the Vikings who

445
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,360
sacked and burnt a religious center that

446
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,039
stood here before to these pagan pirates

447
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,769
rampaging out of their longships in 793

448
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:43,710
this great center of Christian piety and

449
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,169
scholarship a pivotal place in the

450
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:48,870
survival of the word and the Gospels was

451
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,370
no more than an undefended treasure

452
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,039
house the jewels that grace the books of

453
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,380
the church became baubles around a

454
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,159
vikings neck

455
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,400
today the Vikings may seem romantic

456
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
re-enacting their rituals a good day out

457
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,140
over 12 centuries ago their arrival was

458
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,090
not so cheerful to many it seemed to

459
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,070
signal the end for civilization

460
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,140
a year after raising Lindisfarne the

461
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,110
Vikings returned and sacked Jarrow the

462
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,029
abbey where beed had been the greatest

463
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,250
scholar in one of the finest libraries

464
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:37,309
and Christendom this stronghold of the

465
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,620
Latin word where English was also being

466
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,779
written down uniquely among European

467
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:44,240
dialects was burned to the ground it's

468
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,289
books with it

469
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,710
it was the start of 70 years of attack

470
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,019
during which the Vikings savaged this

471
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,990
eastern half of the country few stories

472
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,210
survived of exactly where and when they

473
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,730
attacked perhaps chillingly because few

474
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,769
were left to tell the tale

475
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:17,870
but first the Raiders went home with

476
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,210
their plunder then they decided to take

477
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,269
the land itself in 865 the Vikings

478
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,519
landed a great army south of here in

479
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,210
East Anglia

480
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,150
within five years the Viking invaders

481
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,460
who are now called Danes controlled the

482
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,179
north and east of the country of the old

483
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,880
anglo-saxon kingdoms only Wessex still

484
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,210
held out Old Norse the language of the

485
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,070
conquerors was spreading throughout the

486
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,039
land Old English potentially faced the

487
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,900
same fate as the Celtic language it had

488
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,669
supplanted virtual oblivion English was

489
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:02,090
in need of a champion and it found one

490
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,880
King Alfred statue stands here in

491
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,530
Winchester the capital of his ancient

492
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,840
kingdom of Wessex he's the only monarch

493
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,580
in our history to be known as the Great

494
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,040
and he's often been hailed as the savior

495
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,650
of England that may be debatable as the

496
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,080
idea of a single unified England didn't

497
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,570
really exist in Alfred's day what is

498
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,730
certain is that he was a great defender

499
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,050
of the English language

500
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,420
it was the Victorians who dubbed Alfred

501
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,300
the Great he was one of their darlings

502
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
an English hero whose exploits were

503
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,020
enthusiastically woven into the fabric

504
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,070
of national myth but he very nearly

505
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,600
didn't make it he come to the throne of

506
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
Wessex within a year of the first Danish

507
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,860
attacks in the southeast and at first he

508
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,550
could hardly hold them back in 878 the

509
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,990
Danes were on what appeared to be a

510
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,670
decisive battle at Chippenham in

511
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,270
Wiltshire

512
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:17,509
alfred with only a few followers went on

513
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:19,279
the run into the marshes of somerset

514
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,249
moving as a contemporary road under

515
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:24,529
difficulties through woods and into

516
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:29,259
inaccessible places legend has Alfred

517
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,119
unrecognised taking shelter in a poor

518
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,070
woman's cottage and being scolded for

519
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,599
burning the wheat and cakes he'd been

520
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,059
set to mind but the reality was less

521
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,599
cozy his situation was desperate and if

522
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,940
Alfred's Kingdom fell the whole country

523
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,529
would be controlled and settled by

524
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:50,299
conquerors whose language would

525
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:58,009
inevitably crush English but Alfred

526
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,079
proved to be an enterprising warrior and

527
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,599
strategist running free in the Somerset

528
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,489
Levels he discovered the arts of

529
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,799
irregular warfare and mounted guerrilla

530
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,869
attacks against the occupying forces of

531
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,519
go thrown the Danish invader

532
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,499
but he knew that wasn't going to be

533
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,409
enough for Wessex to be regained the

534
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,999
Danes had to be brought to battle and

535
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:19,519
defeated the fighting men of Wessex had

536
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,409
been scattered but in the spring of 878

537
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,419
night Alfred sent out a call for the men

538
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,639
of the Shire foods the county armies to

539
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,729
join him around 4000 men mainly from

540
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,559
Wiltshire and Somerset armed only with

541
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,329
battle axes and throwing spears

542
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,999
responded to the call they mustered at

543
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:37,099
Egberts stone were trackways and

544
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,949
ridgeway's met 48 hours later they

545
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:42,649
advanced shields drumming against the

546
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,349
danish army of 5000 holding high ground

547
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:47,569
at athens ooon on the western edge of

00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:50,029
soars reply contemporary English

549
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,769
accounts described the battle that

550
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,809
followed as a slaughter and a rout of

551
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,509
the Danes by the West Saxons modern

552
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,459
historians question that but there's no

553
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:01,429
doubt that Alfred prevailed his crown

554
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:04,069
and his kingdom were secured and more

555
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,469
importantly for our story so is the

556
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:09,069
English language

557
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,330
the Dane surrendered the leader was

558
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,610
baptized as a Christian and Alfred's

559
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,799
crucial victory was memorialized here in

560
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,110
Russia in an earlier version of a great

561
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,690
white horse carved into the land deep

562
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,110
saved

563
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,220
alfred left an even more significant

564
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,210
mark on the country

565
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,100
he signed a peace treaty with the danes

566
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,870
which established a border running up

567
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,490
through the country from the thames to

568
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,179
the old Roman road of Watling street the

569
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,799
land to the north and east to be known

570
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,540
as the Danelaw would be under Danish

571
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,179
rule the land to the south and west

572
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,120
would be for the English no one was to

573
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:05,850
cross the line unless to trade in the

574
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,799
course of time because of Alfred's peace

575
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,350
treaty when Danes in English met they

576
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,660
didn't do so to fight but to do business

577
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,870
even to intermarry communities mixed and

578
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,630
so did the languages in English rather

579
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,340
than being engulfed by the Danes

580
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:30,450
language began to absorb it I'm in the

581
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,490
market town of Hexham in the northeast

582
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,010
of England maps of the area showed just

583
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,380
how widespread the Danish settlement was

584
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,960
place names ending in by reveal the

585
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,270

a portion of land the births marriages

588
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,690
and deaths pages of the local paper

589
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,600
feature lots of names ending in son that

590
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
was a Danish way of making a name by

591
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,559
adding to the name of the father just on

592
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,240
this page I can see Harrison Gibson

593
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,370
Hudson Robson Sanderson Dickenson

594
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,299
Simpson Dickinson again and Watson and

595
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,380
school where I was just across the

596
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,299
country there was a Pattinson a Johnson

597
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,299
a role in some not another Dixon outside

598
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,490
in the street you can see the same thing

599
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,780
on shop signs everywhere

600
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,110
even give the centuries of people moving

601
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,570
around the country names ending in Sun

602
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,820
are still far more common in what were

603
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,740
the Danish territories of the north and

604
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,470
west than they are in the south and east

605
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,850
but all you can hear the echoes of the

606
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,250
Danes Old Norse language in the way

607
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,440
people speak surely Allah and of the the

608
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,169
Sailor man lemme Carolyn it's a little

609
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:59,389
field on its own really sensors are back

610
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:01,490
down by the side of it looks down to a

611
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,080
little water in the structure looking a

612
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,570
second down by the you know don't bite

613
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,190
you're not going if you it's like a

614
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,399
little isolation feely Johnny it's only

615
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,740
a couple of acres the whole thing

616
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,730
interests me see if you sheep showed

617
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,490
would love it for debate today there

618
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,740
some Old Norse word stayed in the local

619
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,029
dialect of the north

620
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,600
words like Beck for stream and Garth for

621
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,360
paddock as a boy Rick and I remember

622
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,220
hearing and using dialect words like

623
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,649
Slattery for shower slate for slippery

624
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:34,279
yet for gait lab Philippe yech for oaken

625
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,279
yam for home as in arzga and young pure

626
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,620
nose heard in Wigton every night of the

627
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,059
week and there are many others but the

628
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,980
influence of Old Norse wasn't just local

629
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,010
or on the country over time hundreds of

630
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,990
Norse words entered the mainstream of

631
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,370
English and we still use them every day

632
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,440
the SK sound is a characteristic of Old

633
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,570
Norse and English borrowed words like

634
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,960
score and sky and skive as well as

635
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,700
perhaps a thousand others including

636
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,668
anger bull freckle knife neck root skull

637
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:13,628
and window

638
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,429
sometimes we're both Old Norse and Old

639
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,290
English had a word for the same thing

640
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,599
both words lived on in English each

641
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,280
taking on a slightly different meaning

642
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,549
where Old English said craft Old Norse

643
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:33,879
said skill for an English hide the North

644
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,579
said skin in Oldham she was sick

645
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:42,849
in Norse you're ill here was another

646
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,559
example of English as extraordinary

647
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,230
ability to absorb to take in words from

648
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,418
other languages adding them to its word

649
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:51,460
hoard increasing the richness and

650
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,609
flexibility of the vocabulary I think

651
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:56,619
that the point about my cover is how

652
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:58,720
much it astonishes by its ordinary

653
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,700
nature words like law egg husband leg

654
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,049
LLL die ugly all these words are from

655
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,520
Old Norse and yet you wouldn't

656
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,230
necessarily think they were foreign at

657
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,480
all most astounding of all I think other

658
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,720
pronouns they their and them those are

659
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,599
also from Old Norse an in terms of

660
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,000
grammar in a way they simplified English

661
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
didn't they took it away from its

662
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
Germanic roots these probably true to

663
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,549
say that Old Norse affects the English

664
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:29,829
language more than any other visit

665
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,869
actually leads to a restructuring of the

666
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:34,960
language Old English form sentences and

667
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,260
not by word order as we do but by

668
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,089
tacking on endings on to the ends of

669
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:42,400
things like articles and pronouns and

670
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,640
nouns and what happens is through

671
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,220
contact with a pretty similar language a

672
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,500
lot of these inflectional endings start

673
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,450
to lose their distinctive nature and

674
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,950
actually this is a process that we can

675
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,299
see happening fairly early on in the

676
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:57,369
anglo-saxon period so the language is

677
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:59,710
prone to do that but contact with north

678
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,869
language just speed eases up gave it a

679
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,240
shove towards modernity can you give us

680
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,000
a very simple example of that yes let's

681
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,190
take a simple sentence like and the King

682
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,770
gave horses to his men that would be

683
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,359
something like in Old English say

684
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,099
chimney gave blank an his guru now in

685
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,960
Old English you didn't tend to have a

686
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,359
preposition like to instead you could

687
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:24,730
use a special ending which kind of meant

688
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,100
to his men

689
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,180
and that would be um a um ending and you

690
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,370
just tack that onto the end of the noun

691
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,180
for man so you'd have Ghulam

692
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,610
um ending now the plural for the word

693
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,890
for horse you will say gave horses to

694
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,050
his men would be have an N on it so

695
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,290
every blonde can unfortunately towards

696
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,790
the end of the old english period we

697
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,370
start to see that um ending becoming

698
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,760
more and more indistinct and we see

699
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,990
spellings like GU man a n just the same

700
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,850
as blank and a n it's obvious that the

701
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,490
king is more likely to give horses to

702
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,530
his men men men to his horses but you

703
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,880
can see that there's a potential there

704
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,700
for difficulties and so we start to see

705
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,120
and prepositions being used in place of

706
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,580
those endings which has become

707
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:24,060
indistinct spoken English survived the

708
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,510
Danish invasion but as the ninth century

709
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,180
drew to a close the written culture was

710
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,610
in a ruinous State and King Alfred was

711
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,930
concerned when Alfred looked at the

712
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,790
state of his kingdom he was appalled the

713
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,860
scholars in the monasteries had once

714
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,840
made England the greatest powerhouse of

715
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,910
Christian teaching in Europe but a

716
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,440
hundred and fifty years had passed since

717
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,570
the High days of bead and the scholarly

718
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,030
tradition had declined hastened on its

719
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,150
way by a century of Viking reigns in all

720
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,100
the country Alfred could barely find a

721
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,660
handful of priests who could read and

722
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,910
understand Latin and if they couldn't

723
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,950
understand Latin they couldn't pass on

724
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,360
the teachings of the religious books

725
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,640
that told people how to lead virtuous

726
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,150
lives they couldn't save souls where the

727
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,190
written word had once flourished alfred

728
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,500
now found only chronic spiritual

729
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,920
sickness he looked for a cure one way

730
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,680
was to educate more clergy in latin but

731
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,690
that wasn't enough he hit on a more

732
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,880
radical solution a solution that hinged

733
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,850
not on Latin but on English and he took

734
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,230
English to new heights of achievement

735
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,779
in the preface to his own translation of

736
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,150
Pope Gregory's pastoral care alfred

737
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,059
wrote I remembered how before it was all

738
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,400
ravaged and burned I'd seen how the

739
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,259
churches throughout all England stood

740
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:45,089
filled with treasures and books and

741
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,460
there was also a multitude of God's

742
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,200
servants who had very little benefit

743
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,999
from those books because they couldn't

744
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,160
understand anything of them since they

745
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,230
were not written in that own language

746
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,970
their own language was of course English

747
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,380
Alfred didn't want to do away with Latin

748
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,119
but he realized that it would be far

749
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,130
easier to teach people to read books

750
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,440
written in the language they spoke the

751
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,480
best scholars could then go on to learn

752
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,029
Latin and join Holy Orders the rest

753
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,160
would still have access to scholarship

754
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,170
and spiritual guidance but it would be

755
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:28,859
written in English here in his capital

756
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,180
city of Winchester Alfred drew up a plan

757
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,039
it was an extraordinarily imaginative

758
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,680
project to promote literacy and restore

759
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,549
the English language

760
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,440
we should he wrote translate certain

761
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,450
books which are most necessary for all

762
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,369
men to know into the language that we

763
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,710
can all understand and also arrange it

764
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,290
as with God's help we very easily can if

765
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,510
we have peace so that all the youth of

766
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,310
freemen now among the English people

767
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,619
will have the means to be able to devote

768
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,470
themselves to it may be set to study for

769
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,230
as long as they're of no other use until

770
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,180
the time that able to read English

771
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,070
writing well Alfred had five books of

772
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,869
religious instruction philosophy and

773
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:24,670
history translated from Latin into

774
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,800
English a laborious and costly

775
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,950
undertaking

776
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,800
copies were sent out to the 12 bishops

777
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,540
of his kingdom for their wisdom to be

778
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,700
spread as widely as possible to each

779
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,980
bishop to emphasize the importance and

780
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,060
value of the project

781
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Alfred sent a costly pointer used to

782
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,680
underline the text this is the Alfred

783
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,310
jewel

784
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,710
many historians believe that it formed

785
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,860
the head of one of those pointers

786
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,900
crafted in Crystal and enamel gold it

787
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,450
was discovered in 1693 in Somerset and

788
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,910
is now on show at the Ashmolean Museum

789
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,240
in Oxford it's inscribed Alfred had me

790
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,060
made in English Alfred the Great had

791
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,340
made the English language to jewel in

792
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,030
his crown

793
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,350
here in Winchester Alford had

794
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,000
established what was effectively a

795
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,369
publishing house other projects he

796
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:31,260
undertook included the commissioning of

797
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,570
the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle detailing

798
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,510
hundreds of years of history. 

799
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,150
Alfred died in 899, one of his legacies was an

800
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,530
English language which is more

801
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,960
prestigious and widely read than ever before.

802
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,720
There was nothing to compare with

803
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,000
this range of written vernacular history,

804
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,100
philosophy, poetry, anywhere else in mainland Europe.

805
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,590
English was out on its own. 

806
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,869
By the middle of the 11th century

807
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:57,990
English seemed secure, but now other

808
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,030
invaders were waiting in the wings and

809
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,609
English was about to face its greatest threat ever.

810
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:05,750


811
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,770
This place, the old Roman forte Pevensey,

812
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,450
was a fateful one for the English language.

813
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,670
It was here among other places

814
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,680
that the Frisians and other Germanic tribes

815
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,450
had made landfall in the 5th century 

816
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,800
and introduced their own language.

817
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,640
Now in 1066 another wave of invaders was landing : the Normans.

818
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,170


819
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,630
When in 1066 William, Duke of Normandy, sailed

820
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,130
with his army to claim the English throne,

821
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,620
 he was sure he had right on his side.

822
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,250
The English King Edward the Confessor 

823
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,200
had spent many years in Normandy 

824
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,450
and in that time contemporaryhe sources 

825
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,460
say had come to regard William as a brother or even a son. 

826
00:42:59,460 --> 00:42:59,580


827
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,900
And he named him as his successor. 

828
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,180
Sensing his impending death and fearing rebellion at home,

829
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,580
 the childless Edward had dispatched

830
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,220
Harold Godwinson, his wife's brother and his Earl of Essex, 

831
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,850
the richest and most powerful of the English Lords, 

832
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:15,850


833
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,070
to Normandy to pledge loyalty to William.

834
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:25,770
This Harold did, swearing on two caskets of holy relics.

835
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,670


836
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,820
But when Edward did die, Harold,

837
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,950
supported by the English nobility had

838
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,020
himself crowned in Westminster Abbey 

839
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,060
on the very day that Edward was laid to rest there.

840
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,720


841
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,000
To the truculent and ruthless William

842
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,790
this was an affront. 

843
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:50,250
Invasion with maximum force (was) the only possible response.

844
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:11,500
The armies met here near Hastings. 

845
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,420
This is the spot where traditionally Harold fell, 
fatally pierced through the eye with an arrow. 

846
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,250


847
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,440
The site was later named after the engagement,

848
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,030
but it's named not with an English word like "fight"

849
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:28,110
 

850
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:35,700
but with a word from the language of the Norman Victor's, âBattleâ. 

851
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,410


852
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,180
Harold would be the last English-speaking King of England for three centuries. 

853
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,750


854
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,940
On Christmas Day 1066 William was crowned in Westminster Abbey

855
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,250
in a service conducted in English and Latinï¼

856
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:53,040
William spoke French throughout.

857
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,240
A new king and a new language were in authority in England. 

858
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,230
"enemy" "castle"

859
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,910
 "castle" was one of the first French words

860
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,440
to enter the English language.

861
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,359
the Normans built a chain of them to

862
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,180
impose their rule on the country.

863
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,430
This magnificent castle at Rochester was one

864
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,230
of the first to be fortified in stone.

865
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,690
By blood the Normans were from the same

866
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,000
stock as the Norseman who'd invaded in

867
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,160
earlier centuries but they no longer

868
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,620
spoke a Germanic language. Rather would

869
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,960
we call old French which had grown from

870
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,780
Latin roots. Many of the words they spoke

871
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,340
would have been very strange to the

872
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,640
native English but would quickly become

873
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,340
unpleasantly familiar. Arm words "army"

874
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,420
"archer" "soldier" "garrison" and "guard" all

875
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,380
come from the conquering Norman French.

876
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,180
French was the language that spelled out

877
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,040
the architecture of the new social order.

878
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,480
"crown" "throne" and "court", "duke" "baron" and

879
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,900
"nobility" "peasant" "vassal" "servant", the word

880
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,270
"govern" comes from French as do "liberty"

881
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,660
"authority" "obedience" and "traitor".

882
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,010
The Normans took the law into their own

883
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,340
hands: "felony" "arrest" "warrant" "justice"

884
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,030
"judge" and "jury" all come from French and

885
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:25,870
so do "accuse" "acquit" "sentence" "condemned"

886
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:31,150
"prison" and "jail". It's been estimated that

887
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,470
in the three centuries after the

888
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,780
conquest about ten thousand French words

889
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,150
colonized the English language. 

890
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,070
They didn't all come in immediately but the

891
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,900
conquest opened a conduit of French

892
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,940
vocabulary that remain open on and off

893
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,000
ever since. Today French words are all

894
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,590
around us: "city" "market"

895
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,230
"porter". Here we are, look ??? ???

896
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,480
"salmon" weighs about 14 pound, it is a

897
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,280
fabulous fish. We've got some fabulous

898
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,990
"mackerel", they've come out from Aberdeen,

899
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,940
next door the "oysters" they come from the

900
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:08,280
Essex coast "sole". "pork" "sausage" "bacon"

901
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,720
"fruit" "oranges" "limon" "grape" "tart"

902
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:23,740
"biscuit" "sugar" "cream" "fry" "vinegar". 

903
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,260
Nearly 500 words dealing with food cooking and

904
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,090
eating alone entered English from French,

905
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,610
just a fraction of the imports which

906
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,350
would enrich the English word hoard in

907
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,030
the centuries after the Norman Conquest.

908
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,310
Within 20 years of taking control of the

909
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,560
country, William sent his officers out to

910
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,370
take stock of his kingdom. The monks of

911
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,200
Peterborough who were still recording

912
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,850
the events of history in English in the

913
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,890
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted

914
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,050
disapprovingly: "they're not one piece of

915
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,870
land escaped the survey, not even an ox

916
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,610
or a cow or a pig".

917
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,210
The Doomsday Book, there are in fact two

918
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,150
volumes, show us how complete the Norman

919
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,579
takeover of English land was and how

920
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:26,319
widespread their influence and their

921
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,150
language. The Norman settlement had

922
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,799
concentrated the wealth of England more

923
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:35,349
than ever before or since. The native

924
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,790
ruling class from before the conquest

925
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,650
had been slaughtered, banished or

926
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,809
disinherited in favor of William's

927
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:43,390
followers. Half of the country was in the

928
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,040
hands of just a 190 men,

929
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,559
half of that was helped......  The English

930
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,079
language had been forced underground. It

931
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,390
would take 300 years for it to re-emerge

932
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,940
and when it did, it would have changed

933
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,869
dramatically.
